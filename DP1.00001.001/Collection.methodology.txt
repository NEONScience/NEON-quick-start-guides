2D wind speed and direction is measured using a solid-state anemometer at the top of the aquatic meteorological station, and on each measurement level of the tower, excluding the tower top. Measurement level height is determined on a site-specific basis. Measurements are representive of a spatial point throughout time and are made at 0.1 Hz. Data are published as 2- and 30-minute temporally averaged data products.
