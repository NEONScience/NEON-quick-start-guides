The data products of Instrumented Systems are flagged by a number of quality assurance checks. These can be either for indiviudal measurements or as a summary from averaged measurements. An automated despiking algorithm is used as part of the data quality checks in place for this data product among other quality flags and quality metrics. In cases where sensors failed calibration a "Suspect Calibration" flag will be added to the corresponding data. Range tests are used to ensure observations fall within the ideal minimum and maximum values. Any large jumps in the data that might be missed with the Range test are typically captured with a Step test. Similarly, persistence tests are used to ensure the fluctuation of recorded values is realistic. If there are missing data points, a null test monitors the amount of missing points over a given period of time.
