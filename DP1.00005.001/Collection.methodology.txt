IR biological temperature is measured using infrared radiometers installed at several measurement levels on the tower infrastructure and at the middle soil plot of the soil array. Measurements represent a point on the target surface (relative to the sensor's location, angle, and field-of-view), are made at a frequency of 1 Hz, and data are published as 1-minute and 30-minute average values.
