Sensor height] (zOffset; m) and the latitude, longitude (referenceLatitude, referenceLongitude; Â°), and elevation (m) of the tower or soil plot reference corner are in the sensor positions file (...sensor_positions...csv). Use the HOR.VER component of the time series file name (horizontalPosition and verticalPosition if stacked using neonUtilities) to link to the corresponding row in the HOR.VER column of the sensor positions file. HOR indices correspond to the horizontal location of the tower or soil plot, and VER indices correspond to vertical location such as higher measurement levels on the tower. Soil plot sensors will have a HOR index of their plot number and no VER index.
