Primary - weighing gauge housed within a small double fence intercomparison reference, which is generally located within 0.5 km of the tower infrastructure. Secondary - tipping bucket located on the top of the tower infrastructure. Throughfall - tipping buckets at 4 or 5 soil array locations (absent at short-stature ecosystems). On flat ground the throughfall collection area is between 37.5 and 50 cm aboveground. Bulk precipitation is determined at five- and thirty-minute intervals for primary precipitation and at one- and thirty-minute intervals for secondary and throughfall precipitation.
