The latitude, longitude (referenceLatitude, referenceLongitude; Â°), and elevation (m) of the tower reference corner, soil plot reference corner, or primary precipitation collector base are in the sensor positions file (...sensor_positions...csv). Use the HOR.VER component of the time series file name (horizontalPosition and verticalPosition if stacked using neonUtilities) to link to the corresponding row in the HOR.VER column of the sensor positions file. HOR indices 000, 001-005, and 900 correspond to the tower, soil plots 1-5, and the primary precipitation collector, respectively, and VER indices correspond to the tower measurement level for secondary precipitation. Sensor height (zOffset; m) relative to the tower reference corner is reported for secondary precipitation.
