3D windspeed and temperature is measured at the tower top using a sonic anemometer at 20 Hz acquisitional frequency. The sonic anemotmeter measures wind speed and the speed of sound on three nonorthogonal axes, from which orthogonal windspeed and temperature are derived. Published data is available in 1- and 30- minute averaging intervals. This data is only available within the eddy covariance bundle (DP4.00200) and is used alongside other data products to generate the momentum flux, sensible heat flux, latent heat flux and carbon flux data products.
