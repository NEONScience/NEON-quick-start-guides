3D wind speed, direction and temperature are measured by a 3D sonic anemometer operating at 20 Hz at the tower top. Sonic anemometer wind speed, direction, and temperature are derived from transit time measurements of sound pulses transmitted between paired sonic transducers facing each other along a measurement path. This data product is used alongside other data products to generate the momentum flux, sensible heat flux, latent heat flux and CO2 flux data products.
