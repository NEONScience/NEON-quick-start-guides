The Attitude and Motion Reference System (AMRS) uses gyroscopes in combination with accelerometer and magnetometer data to provide 3D orientation measurements. The AMRS is mounted on top of the 3D sonic anemometer at the tower top and helps assess effects of boom vibration and movement for processing of Eddy Covariance Turbulent Exchange gas flux data. This AMRS sensor is configured to use forward-left-up body coordinate system, and data is reported in east-north-up reference coordinate system. Raw data from the AMRS sensor are recorded at a rate of 40Hz, and are used to calculate the summarized data published to the portal at 1-min and 30-min time resolution.
