Each data sub-product value is accompanied by a final quality flag (qfFinl) under the quality flag quality metric (qfqm) section of  the HDF5 file (see HDF5 file structure image for its location). Data with a final quality flag of 1 are potentially erroneous and should be used with caution. The final quality flag is based on automated QA/QC tests, including range, step, and spike tests, as well as a manually set science review flag if applicable following Smith et al. (2014). Each measurement is accompanied by an estimate of measurement uncertainty under the uncertainty (ucrt) section of the HDF5 file (see HDF5 file structure image for its location).

Please note that quality checks are comprehensive but not exhaustive; therefore, unknown data quality issues may exist. Also note that, conversely, some quality-flagged data are still usable depending on the scientific use case. Additionally, these [Level 1 data](https://www.neonscience.org/data-samples/data-management/data-processing) are not currently gap-filled or corrected for sensor drift or shifts, such as those introduced by sensor swaps or field calibrations. Users are advised to evaluate quality of the data as relevant to the scientific research question being addressed, perform data review and post-processing prior to analysis, and use the data quality flags, issue logs, and maintenance records included in download packages to aid interpretation. A tutorial with examples of how to do this can be found [here](https://www.neonscience.org/resources/learning-hub/tutorials/clean-neon-ais-data).
