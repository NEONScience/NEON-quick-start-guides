Wet deposition samples are collected by an automated climate controlled collector assembly with an optical precipitation detector. The collector is located at the tower top at terrestrial sites, and at the meteorological station at a subset of aquatic sites. The onset of precipitation causes the retractable lid to open so that precipitation may be collected in the glass bottles inside the enclosure. Once precipitation has ceased the lid closes until the next event is detected. Bottles are exchanged approximately every two weeks. If a precipitation event occurred in those two weeks the samples are sent to an external laboratory for analysis and archiving.
