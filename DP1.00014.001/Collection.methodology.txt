Global and diffuse shortwave radiation are measured using a pyranometer. Measurements are made at the tower top at terrestrial sites, are representative of a spatial point throughout time, and are made at 1 Hz.  Direct radiation is not directly measured, rather, it is derived from global and diffuse radiation measurements. Data are published as 1- and 30- minute temporal averages.
