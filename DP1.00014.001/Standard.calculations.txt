Sensor height (zOffset; m) and the latitude, longitude (referenceLatitude, referenceLongitude; °), and elevation (m) of the tower reference corner are in the sensor positions file (...sensor_positions...csv). Use the HOR.VER component of the time series file name (horizontalPosition and verticalPosition if stacked using neonUtilities) to link to the corresponding row in the HOR.VER column of the sensor positions file. HOR index 000 corresponds to the tower, and the maximum VER index at each site corresponds to the tower top.
