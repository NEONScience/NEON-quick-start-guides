A particulate size analyzer (DustTrak) measures different size fractions of particulate matter (PM) continuously ranging from 0.1um to 15um and sorts them into PM size fractions of </= 1, 2.5, 4, 10 and 15 um.  To decrease known bias optical mesaurements of PM, samples will be collected when ambient relative humidity (RH) is <50%.  30 minute and hourly median values are calculated.
