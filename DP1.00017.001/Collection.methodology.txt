A particulate size analyzer (DustTrak) measures different size fractions of particulate matter (PM) continuously ranging from 0.1um to 15um and sorts them into PM size fractions of </= 1, 2.5, 4, 10 and 15 um. Data are reported as 30 minute and hourly median values. To decrease known bias in optical measurements of PM, medians are calculated both for all data, and for only those observations made when ambient relative humidity (RH) is <50%.
