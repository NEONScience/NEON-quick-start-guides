Each size class category is accompanied by a final quality flag (PM#FinalQF). NEON recommends only using data where the corresponding final quality flag is 0. Data with a final quality flag of 1 are potentially inaccurate and should only be used with caution. The final quality flag is based on automated QA/QC tests, including range, step and spike, as well as a manually set science review flag if applicable. Each measurement is accompanied by an estimate of measurement uncertainty, expressed as median absolute deviation of particulate size and distribution (PM#MAD) which comprises known and quantifiable uncertainties.
