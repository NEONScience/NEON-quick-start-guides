Shortwave and longwave radiation (collectively referred to as net radiation) are measured using a four component net radiometer. Net radiation is measured at the tower top of terrestrial sites and at aquatic meteorological stations.  Additional longwave radiation measurements are collected at one of the soil plots at terrestrial sites. Measurements are representative of a spatial point throughout time and are made at 1 Hz. Data are published as 1- and 30- minute temporal averages.
