Sensor height (zOffset; m) and the latitude, longitude (referenceLatitude, referenceLongitude; Â°), and elevation (m) of the tower reference corner or aquatic meteorological station base are in the sensor positions file (...sensor_positions...csv). Use the HOR.VER component of the time series file name (horizontalPosition and verticalPosition if stacked using neonUtilities) to link to the corresponding row in the HOR.VER column of the sensor positions file. HOR indices 000 and 001-005 correspond to the tower and soil plots 1-5, respectively, and VER indices 010-080 increase with increasing height on the tower, while VER=000 corresponds to the soil plot measurement level.
