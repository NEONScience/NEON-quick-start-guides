Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) is measured using an upward-facing radiation sensor on the aquatic meteorological station and at each measurement level on the tower, with an additional downward-facing PAR located at the tower top. The height of each measurement level is determined on a site-specific basis. Measurements represent a point, are made at 1 Hz, and data are published in 1- and 30-minute averaging intervals.
