RGB and IR images are captured using a Stardot NetCam on the top of all terrestrial towers to study above-canopy phenology. Every 15 minutes each camera captures back-to-back RGB and IR images separated by 30 seconds. Images are directly transmitted to the Phenocam Network for analysis, archiving, and display.
