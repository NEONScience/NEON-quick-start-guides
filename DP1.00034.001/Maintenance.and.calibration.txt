IRGA is factory calibrated and in-house calibrated by NEON Calibration Validation Audit Lab (CVAL) prior to field deployment, and re-calibrated on 6-month basis by CVAL. Sensors that fail to meet requirements are sent for factory calibration. Field validation is performed in situ every 23.5 hours using a sequence of CO2 reference gas standards. Preventative maintenance is performed when needed.
