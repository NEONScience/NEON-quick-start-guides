Atmospheric CO2 isotopes is measured using a carbon isotope analysis system at each measurement level of the tower. Measurement level height is determined on a site-specific basis. Measurements represent a spatial point in time, are made at 1 Hz, and data are published in 9- and 30-minute averaging intervals.
