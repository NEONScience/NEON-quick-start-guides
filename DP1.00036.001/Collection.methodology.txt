Wet and dry mole fraction of CO2 and water vapor (H2O) and 13C stable isotope ratio are measured at 1 Hz using a cavity ring-down (CRD) spectrometer located in the instrument hut. Air samples are pulled from inlets at each vertical measurement level on the tower and delivered to the analyzer through Teflon tubing.
