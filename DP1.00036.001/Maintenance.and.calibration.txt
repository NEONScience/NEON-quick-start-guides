The CRD spectrometer is factory calibrated and in-house calibrated by NEON Calibration Validation Audit Lab (CVAL) prior to field deployment, and re-calibrated on an annual basis by CVAL. Field validation is performed in situ every 23 hours using a sequence of CO2 reference gas standards. Preventative maintenance is performed when needed.
