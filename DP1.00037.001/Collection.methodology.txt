Wet and dry mole fraction of water vapor (H2O) and 18O and 2H stable isotope ratio in water vapor (â€°) are measured at 1 Hz using a cavity ring-down (CRD) spectrometer located in the instrument hut. Air samples are pulled from inlets at each vertical measurement level on the tower and delivered to the analyzer through Teflon tubing.
