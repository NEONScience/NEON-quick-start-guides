The CRD spectrometer is factory calibrated and in-house calibrated by NEON Calibration Validation Audit Lab (CVAL) prior to field deployment, and re-calibrated on an annual basis in situ by CVAL. Field validation is performed in situ every 23 hours using a sequence of reference liquid water standards. Preventative maintenance is performed when needed.
