Stable isotope concentrations in precipitation samples are collected by an automated wet deposition collector assembly with an optical precipitation detector at the tower top and at some aquatic instrumentation sites. The onset of precipitation causes the retractable lid to open so that precipitation may be collected in the glass bottles inside the enclosure. Once precipitation has ceased the lid closes until the next event is detected. Samples are collected approximately every two weeks and spatially represent a point where the collector is located. If a precipitation event occured in those two weeks the samples are sent to an external laboratory for analysis and archiving.
