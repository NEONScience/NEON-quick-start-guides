Field-level data quality flags with accompanying remarks can be found in the wdi_collection and wdi_collectionIso tables, in the equipmentProblems and isoSubsampleCondition fields. The wdi_isoPerSample table conveys measurement/detection issues encountered by the external lab. The ...externalLabSummaryData table contains information on external lab methods and long-term quality metrics.

Please note that quality checks are comprehensive but not exhaustive; therefore, unknown data quality issues may exist. Users are advised to evaluate quality of the data as relevant to the scientific research question being addressed, perform data review and post-processing prior to analysis, and use the data quality information and issue logs included in download packages to aid interpretation.
