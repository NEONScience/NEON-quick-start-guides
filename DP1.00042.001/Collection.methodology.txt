RGB and IR images are catpured using a Stardot NetCam on the bottom of all terrestrial core and re-locatable towers to study below-canopy phenology. The camera also captures images of snowdepth stakes.  Every 15 minutes each camera captures back-to-back RGB and IR images separated by 30 seconds. Images are directly transmited to the Phenocam Network for analysis, archiving, and display.
