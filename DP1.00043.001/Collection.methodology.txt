The NEON Cimel spectral photometer is model CE-318N. It carries out sun and sky radiance
measurements on several bands (with filters for the 1020, 870, 675, 440, 936, 500, 340, and 380 nm wavelengths with the 1.6 Î¼m spectral channel, but without polarized channels). A sensor head fitted with 25 cm collimators is attached to a 40 cm robot base which systematically points the sensor head at the sun according to a preprogrammed routine. The robot mounted sensor head is parked and pointed near-nadir when idle to prevent deterioration of the optical windows from rain and foreign particles. Data are transmitted from NEON to AERONET, and AERONET hosts a number of additional data products derived from this instrument.
