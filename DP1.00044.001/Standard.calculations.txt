Data are populated with 0 for time periods with no precipitation. Time periods when precipBulk is blank or NA indicate either the sensor was not functioning or the data were redacted by data quality algorithms.

The latitude, longitude (referenceLatitude, referenceLongitude; Â°), and elevation (m) of the weighing gauge precipitation collector base are in the sensor positions file (...sensor_positions...csv). Use the HOR.VER component of the time series file name (horizontalPosition and verticalPosition if stacked using neonUtilities) to link to the corresponding row in the HOR.VER column of the sensor positions file. HOR indices of 900 correspond to the weighing gauge precipitation collector.
