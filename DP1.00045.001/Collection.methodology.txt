Tipping Bucket precipitation is located on the top of the tower infrastructure. Bulk precipitation is determined at one- and thirty-minute intervals. Tipping buckets measurements occur via a collection funnel that channels precipitation down to a tipping lever. On each end of the tipping lever is a small bucket that is calibrated to tip for a known volume of water and the number of times that the lever tips is recorded by a reed switch. The volume of a tip is directly related to precipitation depth based on the surface area of the collector, which allows the rate and quantity of precipitation for a given time period to be determined.
