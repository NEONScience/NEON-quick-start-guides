Data are populated with 0 for time periods with no precipitation. Time periods when precipBulk is blank or NA indicate either the sensor was not functioning or the data were redacted by data quality algorithms.

The latitude, longitude (referenceLatitude, referenceLongitude; Â°), and elevation (m) of the tower reference corner and the soil plot reference corner are in the sensor positions file (...sensor_positions...csv). Use the HOR.VER component of the time series file name (horizontalPosition and verticalPosition if stacked using neonUtilities) to link to the corresponding row in the HOR.VER column of the sensor positions file. HOR indices 000 and 001-005 correspond to the tower and soil plots 1-5, respectively, and VER indices correspond to the tower measurement level for tipping bucket precipitation. Sensor height (zOffset; m) relative to the tower reference corner is reported for tipping bucket precipitation.
