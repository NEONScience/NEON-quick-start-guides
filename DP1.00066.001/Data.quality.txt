Each measurement is accompanied by a final quality flag (finalQF). NEON recommends only using data where the corresponding final quality flag is 0. Data with a final quality flag of 1 are potentially inaccurate and should only be used with caution. The final quality flag is based on automated QA/QC tests, including range, step, and spike tests, as well as a manually set science review flag if applicable. Each measurement is accompanied by its 95% confidence interval (linePARExpUncert) based only on known and quantified uncertainties.
