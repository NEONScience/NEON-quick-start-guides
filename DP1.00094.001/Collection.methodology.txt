Soil water content and salinity are measured using up to eight sensors along a vertical profile extending up to two meters into the soil in all five soil plots. The three shallowest nominal installation depths are 6 cm, 16 cm, and 26 cm (Â±1 cm), with deeper depths determined on a site- and soil plot-specific basis. Both measurements represent an integration across a few centimeters vertically and horizontally around the sensor, are made at 0.1 Hz (10 seconds), and data are published at 1- and 30-minute averaging intervals.
