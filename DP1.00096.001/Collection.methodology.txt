The soil megapit location was chosen to be broadly representative of the five sensor-based soil plots based on soil type, vegetation, and topography. Soil samples were collected by horizon up to 200 cm deep (up to 300 cm at permafrost sites). This package includes data on the soil taxonomy, horizon names, horizon depths, bulk density, texture in the <2 mm soil fraction, and coarse fragments for each soil horizon. The soil megapit was sampled once during construction of terrestrial sites and represents a point in time.
