The dataQF field in each record is a quality flag for known issues applying to the record, added by NEON Science
upon data review. Soil megapit samples were processed at the USDA NRCS Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory. Information on external laboratory methods and standards can be found in the NEON Data Portal Document Library (https://data.neonscience.org/documents) under External Lab Protocols. Quantified and unquantifiable uncertainty metrics based on audit samples and methodology can be found in the NEON User Guide to Soil Chemical Properties: Megapit included in the data package.
