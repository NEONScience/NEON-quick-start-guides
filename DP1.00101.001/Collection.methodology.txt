Atmospheric particulate matter (PM), size fraction 10  m, is measured using a particulate mass analyzer with air flow of approximately 68 cubic meters per minute to collect particulate matter on a quartz microfiber filter. Samples are generated at the top of 6 terrestrial towers, located at Domains 10, 13, and 15. Measurements represent the mass of particulates on the filter which is retrieved bi-weekly. Data are published for each collected filter.
