Atmospheric particulate matter (PM), size fraction PM10, is collected using a high volume dust sampler with air flow of approximately 68 cubic meters per minute, to collect particulate matter on a quartz microfiber filter. Samples are generated at the top of 6 terrestrial towers, located in Domains 10, 13, and 15. Measurements represent the mass of particulates on the filter which is retrieved bi-weekly. Data are published for each collected filter.
