Breeding landbird point counts are conducted by an external contractor. Quality checks conducted before data
are returned to NEON include a 100% check of all data entered into the contractor database to eliminate transcription errors and an "uncommon bird" checkto look for potentially misidentified bird species. Field data is transcribed from the datasheet no later than 14 days after collection including all notes and deviations from procedures. All datasheets are scanned, filed as hardcopy to be mailed to NEON sciec at the end of the sampling season. The "uncommon bird" check is conducted by cantractor staff and partners where by the proofer uses local knowledge, eBird records, field guides, and contact the technician who collected the record for supporting documentation to validate the record.
