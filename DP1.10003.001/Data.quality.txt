Breeding landbird point counts are conducted by an external contractor. Quality checks conducted before data are returned to NEON include a 100% check of all data entered into the contractor database to eliminate transcription errors and an "uncommon bird" check to look for potentially misidentified bird species. Field data are transcribed from the datasheet no later than 14 days after collection including all notes and deviations from procedures. All datasheets are scanned, filed as hardcopy in addition to digital data upload. The "uncommon bird" check is conducted by contractor staff and partners whereby the proofer uses local knowledge, eBird records, field guides, and direct contact with the technician who collected the record for supporting documentation to validate the record. 

Contractors who perform the point counts are periodically tested for identification skill; their quiz results can be found in the brd_personnel table.

Please note that quality checks are comprehensive but not exhaustive; therefore, unknown data quality issues may exist. Users are advised to evaluate quality of the data as relevant to the scientific research question being addressed, perform data review and post-processing prior to analysis, and use the data quality information and issue logs included in download packages to aid interpretation.
