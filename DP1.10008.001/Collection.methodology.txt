Analysis performed by the NRCS as part of the initial site characterization activities. Site variability and soil map units were used to select between 10-34 base plots for sampling, up to 4 tower and 30 distributed per site. In most plots a 1 m x 1 m x 1 m soil pit was excavated. Where a pit sample was not permitted a bucket auger was used to take a 10cm diameter core to 1 m. A representative soil sample for each horizon measured was collected for chemical analyses at the Kellog Soil Survey Laboratory using standard NRCS methods.
