At each plot, three LIDS (Line Intercept Distance Sampling) transects (separated by 120 degrees) radiate outward from the plot centroid, starting 3 m from the plot centroid. The minimum qualifying diameter size of a log increases as the distance from the plot centroid increases. At a minimum, in order to qualify a log must be ≥ 2 cm diameter, ≥ 1 m long, > 45 degrees from vertical (fallen), and < 2 m off the ground. Sampling is repeated every three years.
