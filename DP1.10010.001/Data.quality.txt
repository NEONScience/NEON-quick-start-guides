The dataQF field in each record is a quality flag for post-collection known issues applying to the record. The following dataQF options can be selected: 1) "legacyData" - Data recorded using a paper-based workflow that did not implement the full suite of quality control features associated with the interactive digital workflow, 2) "decayClass NotRecorded" - Records collected with no decayClass.

Please note that quality checks are comprehensive but not exhaustive; therefore, unknown data quality issues may exist. Users are advised to evaluate quality of the data as relevant to the scientific research question being addressed, perform data review and post-processing prior to analysis, and use the data quality information and issue logs included in download packages to aid interpretation.
