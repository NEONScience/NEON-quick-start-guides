Bulk density sampling targets a ranked list of the most abundant decay class x size category x taxon ID (DST) combinations, based on data from the coarse downed wood log survey product. Log bulk density is calculated by collecting disks from downed logs, measuring disk dimensions to enable calculation of disk volume, and weighing disks after oven-drying to constant mass. Bulk Density is calculated as disk dry mass (g) divided by disk volume (cm3). Sampling is scheduled just twice per site, with the second bout 5-6 years after the first bout.
