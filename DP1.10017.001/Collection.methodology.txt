Photos are acquired using a full-frame DSLR camera equipped with a fisheye lens to capture the ‘understory’ and/or ‘overstory’ vegetation at each plot. ‘Understory’ vegetation is less than 2 meters tall and can be captured with an upward or downward facing orientation depending on the vegetation height. ‘Overstory’ vegetation is 2 meters or taller and is captured with an upward-facing camera orientation. Photos for upward facing and overstory images must be captured in the crepuscular hours of the day and downward facing images can be captured during daylight hours. Every 3 years, 20 randomly selected Distributed Plots are sampled within one month of NEON AOP remote-sensing flight over the site and both align with the window of peak greenness as defined by a 10 year mean of the MODIS-EVI greenness index. Every 2 weeks from leaf-out to senescence, DHPs are collected from 3 Tower Plots. Within each plot, DHPs are collected from photo points that are arranged according to the shape of a square cross, oriented in alignment with the cardinal axes, and with points spaced every 4 meters.
