Photos are acquired using a full-frame DSLR camera equipped with a 16 mm fisheye lens to capture the ‘understory’ and/or ‘overstory’ vegetation at each plot. ‘Understory’ vegetation is less than 2 meters tall and can be captured with an upward or downward facing orientation depending on the vegetation height. ‘Overstory’ vegetation is 2 meters or taller and is captured with an upward-facing camera orientation. Photos for upward facing and overstory images must be captured in the crepuscular hours of the day and downward facing images can be captured during daylight hours. Every 5 years per site, 20 randomly selected Distributed Plots are sampled within a one month window that includes the NEON AOP remote-sensing flight date(s) over the site; both DHP collection and the AOP flight align with the window of peak greenness as defined by a 10 year mean of the MODIS-EVI greenness index. Within three Tower Plots, DHPs are collected every 2 weeks from leaf-out to senescence. For both Distributed and Tower Plots, DHPs are collected from photo points that are arranged according to the shape of a square cross, oriented in alignment with the cardinal axes, and with points spaced every 4 meters.
