All NEON DHPs require additonal processing to generate estimates of Leaf Area Index (LAI) or Plant Area Index (PAI). Processing steps may need to include exposure optimization in the 'shadow' or 'dark' region of the histogram and a image format conversion to .JPG for example which can be done using software called Nikon ViewNX 2. To analyze DHPs for LAI and PAI the software Can-Eye can be used.
