Assessing the quality of digital hemispherical photos (DHPs) involves inspecting images for sharp focus, masking out large tree boles close to the camera lens that may inflate estimates of Plant Area Index, and for downward-facing images, masking out the photographer's legs and feet. Image focus may be assessed manually or programmatically (e.g., using Python OpenCV or equivalent). To ensure that DHPs have a high likelihood of being in focus, the protocol requires an f/stop â‰¥ 4 and that the shutter remain open for no longer than 1/30 s. However, it is possible that DHPs that do not meet protocol requirements are nonetheless available for download; it is therefore recommended that data end-users evaluate image f/stop and shutter-speed programmatically (e.g., using the free ExifTool software) as a quick first-pass to identify images that may be out-of-focus.

Please note that quality checks are comprehensive but not exhaustive; therefore, unknown data quality issues may exist. Users are advised to evaluate quality of the data as relevant to the scientific research question being addressed, perform data review and post-processing prior to analysis, and use the data quality information and issue logs included in download packages to aid interpretation.
