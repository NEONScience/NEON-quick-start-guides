NEON DHPs require processing to generate estimates of Leaf Area Index (LAI) or Plant Area Index (PAI). Processing steps may include exposure optimization in the 'shadow' or 'dark' region of the histogram. NEON DHPs may be analyzed programmatically for LAI and PAI using the Python HemiPy package, or manually using Can-Eye software (or equivalent).
