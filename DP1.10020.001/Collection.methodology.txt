16oz deli containers with either 150mL or 250mL of propylene glycol are used as NEON pitfall traps. 3 traps are deployed at 10 distributed base plots for 2 weeks at a time throughout the growing season. Traps are located in the East, West, and South regions of the plots 20m from the center. After field collection, samples are sorted in the lab. Invertebrate bycatch is separated and archived. Vertebrate bycatch is identified to species if possible and archived. Carabids are sorted and identified to species if possible and a subset are pinned or pointed. Of those, another subset is sent to an expert taxonomist and/or a DNA barcoding facility. No more than 95 individuals will recieve DNA barcoding per site per year.
