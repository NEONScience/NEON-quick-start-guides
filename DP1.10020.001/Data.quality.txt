Data quality measures begin at the point of data entry. By constraining formats and controlling values with dropdown menus NEON reduced the number of steps to process raw data. Data are processed using automated methods. These are outlined in the NEON Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document: OS Generic Transitions. A more specific description of constrained can be found in the NEON Raw Data Validation for Ground beetles sampled from pitfall traps (NEON.DP0.10022) which is provided as an additional download with this data product. In accordance with BOLD requirements, there is no quality flagging of sequence metadata on the NEON portal. COI sequences are quality checked by the analytical facility and BOLD, sequences deemed as high quality are those with more than 507 base pairs, less than 1% ambiguous bases and no stop codon/contamination flags. Sequences deemed low quality are flagged for stop codons or contamination. Contamination is defined as having double peaks at almost every base position
