In the bet_fielddata table, the cupStatus, lidStatus, fluidLevel, and sampleCondition fields indicate the status and condition of collection materials and samples at the time of collection. In the tables containing taxonomic identifications, the identificationQualifier field indicates if there was uncertainty in the identification, and the sampleCondition field indicates the condition of samples at the time of identification. In cases in which identifications have changed over time, records are made in the bet_identificationHistory table.
