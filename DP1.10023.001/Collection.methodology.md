At selected terrestrial plots with ≥ 50% herbaceous plant cover, one or two (depending on plot size) 0.1x2m clip strips are randomly located in a 400m^2 plot/subplot. Clipped herbaceous biomass is sorted into functional groups in the field. In the lab, samples are subsampled (if necessary), oven dried, and weighed. At sites managed for grazing, samples are collected with exclosures to account for consumption. At agriculture sites, clip strips are oriented perpendicular to crop rows. Data collection for the Herbaceous clip harvest at Distributed plots was suspended in 2026, leading to a 6-year interval between sampling events rather than the expected 5-year interval. The annual sampling at Tower plots is unaffected by this change and will be carried out in 2026 as usual. Distributed plot sampling originally scheduled for 2026 will be implemented in 2027, and the schedule originally intended for 2027 will be implemented in 2028 and so forth, leading to a consistent 6-year interval between sampling events across all sites in the schedule until 2032.
