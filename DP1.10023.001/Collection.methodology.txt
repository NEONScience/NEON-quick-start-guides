At selected terrestrial plots with â‰¥ 50% herbaceous plant cover, one or two (depending on plot size) 0.1x2m clip strips - area from which hebaceous biomass is collected - are radomly located in a 400m^2 plot/subplot. Clipped herbaceous biomass is sorted into functional groups in the field. In the lab, samples are subsampled (if necessary), oven dried, and weighed. Samples are collected with exclosures to account for consumption at sites managed for grazing. At agriculture sites, clip strips are oriented perpendicular to crop rows.
