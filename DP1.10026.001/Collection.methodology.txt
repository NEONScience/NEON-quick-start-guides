Individual leaf samples are collected from forest and shrubland vegetation, while grasslands are sampled by clipping a full strip of vegetation, similar to the Herbaceous clip harvest (DP1.10023.001) protocol. For woody vegetation, the most abundant species are targeted for sampling; the goal is to provide data for the major canopy species, to facilitate analyses that connect ground sampling to remotely sensed measurements. Georeferencing for woody individuals is accomplished using mapping and tagging, as done in Vegetation structure (DP1.10098.001), or via offsets according to position of the clip harvest cell for clip strips. In addition, shapefiles delineating the outlines of sampled woody individuals are available for some sites and will be generated for other sites on a rolling basis. Foliar sampling is conducted every 5 years, during peak greenness and in conjunction with airborne remote sensing overflights. While this timing generally holds true, from 2026-2032 each site was sampled on a 6-year interval, see data product Issue Log for more detail.
