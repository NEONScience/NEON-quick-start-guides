Foliar sampling is conductedevery 5 years, during peak green.  Forest/shrubland cover sampling occurs at 14 plots.  Grassland sites are sampled from 20 plots.  Four of the plots are located within the tower airshed.   In plots with woody individuals the top 3 most abundant species are identified, one from each species is sampled.  In low diversity sites less than 3 unique species can be sampled.  If there is no clear dominant species a species that has yet to be sampled with sufficient replication is selected. Id aim is to provide data for the major canopy species.  Georeferencing is accomplished using mapping ant tagging as outlined in: Measurement of Vegetation Structure.  In herbaceous sites a homegenized sample is taken using a randomly selected clip strp.
