The cfc_fieldData table contains metadata describing the condition of samples and sampled plants at the time of collection. The analytical tables contain quality flags describing any issues that arose during lab analysis of each sample; typically these fields end in QF, for quality flag. See variables and categoricalCodes files for details on these quality flags. In analytical tables, the field analyticalRepNumber indicates a sample analyzed in replicate for quality control. Tables containing the word "Summary" in the table name contain lab-specific analytical quality information, such as analysis of known standards run as unknowns. See variables file and laboratory SOPs (available in the NEON document library) for details.
