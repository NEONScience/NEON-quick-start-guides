The cfc_fieldData table contains metadata describing the condition of samples and sampled plants at the time of collection. The analytical tables contain quality flags describing any issues that arose during lab analysis of each sample; typically these fields end in QF, for quality flag. See variables and categoricalCodes files for details on these quality flags. In analytical tables, the field analyticalRepNumber indicates a sample analyzed in replicate for quality control. Tables containing the word "Summary" in the table name contain lab-specific analytical quality information, such as analysis of known standards run as unknowns. See variables file and laboratory SOPs (available in the NEON document library) for details.

Please note that quality checks are comprehensive but not exhaustive; therefore, unknown data quality issues may exist. Users are advised to evaluate quality of the data as relevant to the scientific research question being addressed, perform data review and post-processing prior to analysis, and use the data quality information and issue logs included in download packages to aid interpretation.
