Litterfall sampling only occurs in areas where vegetation is > 2m tall. In tall stature vegetation sampling takes place in 20 40 x 40m tower plots, while in short stature sampling takes place in 4 40 x 40m tower plots, plus 26 20x 20m plots. Trap placement in plots with > 50% aerial woody vegetation is randomized utilizing the randomized clip list, in plots with < 50% aerial woody vegetation trap placement is targeted so that only clip cells beneath qualifying vegetation are considered. Each elevated PVC trap is 0.5 m^2 with a mesh "basket" elevated ~80 cm above the ground inside a cliip cell.
