10% of dry mass samples are re-weighed by a different technician to ensure weights are correct. The massSampleID field is unique to each subsample, but replicates will exist if that subsample was reweighed for a quality check.  This is indicated by a Y in the qaDryMass field in the ltr_massdata table. In the chemical analysis data tables, analytical replicates are indicated by the field analyticalRepNumber.

The trapCondition field in the ltr_fielddata table, and the sampleCondition field in the ltr_massdata table, indicate any noted problems with the condition of the trap or the sample at the time of collection and weighing.

The analytical tables contain quality flags describing any issues that arose during lab analysis of each sample; typically these fields end in QF, for quality flag. See variables and categoricalCodes files for details on these quality flags. Tables containing the word "Summary" in the table name contain lab-specific analytical quality information, such as precision and accuracy for each analyte, based analysis of known standards run as unknowns. 

Please note that quality checks are comprehensive but not exhaustive; therefore, unknown data quality issues may exist. Users are advised to evaluate quality of the data as relevant to the scientific research question being addressed, perform data review and post-processing prior to analysis, and use the data quality information and issue logs included in download packages to aid interpretation.
