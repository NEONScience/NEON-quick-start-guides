10% of dry mass samples are re-weighed by a different technician to ensure weights are correct. The massSampleID field is unique to each subsample, but replicates will exist if that subsample was reweighed for a quality check.  This is indicated by a Y in the qaDryMass field in the ltr_massdata table. In the chemical analysis data tables, analytical replicates are indicated by the field analyticalRepNumber.

The trapCondition field in the ltr_fielddata table, and the sampleCondition field in the ltr_massdata table, indicate any noted problems with the condition of the trap or the sample at the time of collection and weighing.
