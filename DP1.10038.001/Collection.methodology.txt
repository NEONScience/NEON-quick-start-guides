Traps consist of fans attached to insulated coolers filled with dry ice and hung from a Shepard’s hook. A small hole in the cooler ensures that as the dry ice sublimates, the CO2 escapes. This is the lure for mosquitoes. The fan distributes the CO2 around the catch cup located under the cooler. Traps are set for day and night collection. The catch cup is tied off and stored on dry ice while the insulated cooler is refilled with dry ice. Mosquitoes are then stored in the -80°C freezer and obvious bycatch is removed. Samples are sent to the laboratory in falcon tubes with tissue paper as padding to protect specimens. Rare and difficult to identify specimens are prioritized for DNA sequencing as data from the Folmer region COI will support identification.
