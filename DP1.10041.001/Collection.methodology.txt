Tier 1 species (Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus) receive top testing priority and are tested from each site with a minimum of 100 specimens available in a year. The next two lower priority groups for testing include Tiers 2 (Culex tarsalis, Culex pipens, and Aedes triseriatus) and 3 (any other individual identified to species within genera Aedes or Culex). These are targeted for testing when a minimum of 200 individuals per site per year are collected. Groups of individuals for testing are assigned a testingID and grouped into pools of 10-50 by species and sampling bout. Because mosquito pathogens are rare, vials are first tested for infection at the genus-level for the three genera of interest (Flavivirus sp., Orthobunyavirus sp., Alphavirus sp.). If the vial tests positive for a given genus of pathogen, the pathogen-specific tests within that genus are performed.
