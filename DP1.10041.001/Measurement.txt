Female mosquitos that have been identified to species and occur in sufficient quantity at a site over a season are eligible for pathogen testing. These females are tested for arboviruses within the families Bunyaviridae, Alphaviridae, and Flaviviridae by external facilities. Test results yield presence and absence of a variety of mosquito pathogens such as West Nile virus, Eastern equine encephalitis virus, La Crosse virus etc.
