Data quality measures begin at the point of data entry. By constraining formats and controlling values with dropdown menus NEON reduced the number of steps to process raw data. Data are processed using automated methods. These are outlined in the NEON Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document: OS Generic Transitions. A more specific description of constraints can be found in the NEON Raw Data Ingest Workbook for TOS Mosquitoes sampled from CO2 traps (NEON.DP0.10043) which is provided as an additional download with this data product. Beginning in 2020, there should always be 20 sampling records, if sampling could not be conducted reasoning in provided in the samplingImpractical field.
