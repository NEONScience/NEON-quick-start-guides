In the mos_trapping table, the fanStatus, catchCupStatus, and dryIceStatus fields record any problems with the trapping apparatus noted at the time of sample collection. The sampleCondition field notes any issues with the sample itself, and is present in the mos_trapping, mos_sorting, and mos_expertTaxonomistID.. tables, tracking whether the condition of the sample changes as it travels through different facilities and analyses. In the mos_sorting table, differences between repeat measurements are noted for count, genus, and species; see variables file for details.
