Analysis performed by the NRCS as part of the initial site characterization activities. Site variability and soil map units were used to select between 10-34 base plots for sampling, up to 4 tower and 30 distributed per site. In most plots a 1 m x 1 m x 1 m soil pit was excavated. Where a pit sample was not permitted a bucket auger was used to take a 10 cm diameter core to 1 m. Precise sampling locations within each plot were recorded so as to not interfere with other sampling activities. The NRCS described the profile of all major horizons, visually estimated very coarse fragment volumes, and collected samples for physical and chemical analyses by horizon.
