Prior to submission, the field and laboratory data undergo standard analytical quality control procedures by the NRCS. Additional checks occur automatically upon submission of data to NEON according to pre-defined data quality constraints and validation rules. Data entry constraints are provided with every data download.  Contained within this file is a field named ‘entryValidationRulesParser’, which describes syntactically the validation rules for each field built into the data ingest process. The dataQF field is used to flag data quality issues manually discovered after data submission. 

Please note that quality checks are comprehensive but not exhaustive; therefore, unknown data quality issues may exist. Users are advised to evaluate quality of the data as relevant to the scientific research question being addressed, perform data review and post-processing prior to analysis, and use the data quality information and issue logs included in download packages to aid interpretation.
