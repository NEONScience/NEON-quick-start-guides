Prior to submission, the field and laboratory data undergo standard analytical quality control procedures by the NRCS. Additional checks occur automatically upon submission of data to NEON according to pre-defined data quality constraints and validation rules. Data entry constraints are provided with every data download.  Contained within this file is a field named ‘entryValidationRulesParser’, which describes syntactically the validation rules for each field built into the data ingest process. The dataQF field is used to flag data quality issues manually discovered after data submission.
