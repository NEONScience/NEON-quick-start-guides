Sampled at all NEON sites.  Forest/Shurbland sites foliar sampling occurs at 14 plots.  At grassland sites foliage is sampled from 20 plots.  At all sites 3 of the plots are located within the tower airshed.  At forest/shrubland sites the top 3 most abundant are identified and one indivudual from each species is samples.  If there is less diversity only 1 species may be sampled.  If there is no clear dominat species, a sample will be taken from a member that has yet to be sampled with less than sufficient replication.  Georefernced individuals are sampled.  These georeferenced plants may have structural data available from vegetation structure sampling.
