Observations are made on no more than 100 individuals along a square 800-meter long primary transect, and no more than 9 individuals in a 200 by 200 meter square plot that overlaps with the site's tower phenocam. Each individual is assessed for each possible phenophase at each bout. Bouts may occur year round at a frequency of once per week, or be seasonal with dynamic scheduling based on phenological activity of interest. Bout scheduling aims to collect observations on each individual approximately 50 times per year. One additional bout per year assesses overall individual health or disease status, along with structural measurements such as height.

The spatial extent of plant phenology data collection was reduced as of 2026. Phenological observations are now made only at core sites. Data collected at gradient sites up until the end of 2025 will remain available on the NEON Data Portal for the lifetime of NEON.
