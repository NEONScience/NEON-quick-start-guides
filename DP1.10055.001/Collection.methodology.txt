Observations are made on no more than 100 individuals along a square 800-meter long primary transect, and no more than 9 indivuduals in a 200 by 200 meter square plot that overlaps with the site's tower phenocam. Each individual is assesed for each possible phenophase at each bout. Bouts may occur year round at a frequency of once per week, or be seasonal with dynamic scheduling based on phenological activity of interest. Bout scheduling aims to collect observations on each individual approximately 50 times per year. One additional bout per year assesses overall individual health or disease status, along with structural measurements such as height.
