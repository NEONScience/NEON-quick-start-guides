Individual spatial information can be calculated from the provided information: the coordinates and elevation of the plot centroid, along with the known dimensions of the phenology transect and the transect meter of each individual. This can also be done automatically using the getLocTOS() function from the geoNEON package, available from https://github.com/NEONScience/NEON-geolocation 

The phe_perindividual and phe_perindividualperyear tables contain an editedDate field, which is used to track new data records about an individual that has already been described (for example, to note an updated taxonomic identification). For the most up-to-date information about each monitored plant, use the record with the most recent editedDate for each individualID.
