Data results from observations in square, multi-scale, 400m^2 plots. At least once per year, the presence and percent cover of species and ancillary variables are documented in 1m^2 subplots. Every other year, species presence is also documented in 10m^2 subplots and 100m^2 subplots, which can be combined to reflect the presence of species across the entire 400m^2 plot. Included information: Taxonomic identification, taxonomic uncertainty when appropriate, nativity, and plot location.
