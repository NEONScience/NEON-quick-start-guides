Uncertainty in taxonomic identification is recorded in the identificationQualifier fields in each table. If identification to species is not possible, identification to a higher taxonomic rank is recorded, and indicated in the taxonRank field. The measuredBy field records the staff member who made the identification, to enable analyses of observer effects.

Please note that quality checks are comprehensive but not exhaustive; therefore, unknown data quality issues may exist. Users are advised to evaluate quality of the data as relevant to the scientific research question being addressed, perform data review and post-processing prior to analysis, and use the data quality information and issue logs included in download packages to aid interpretation.
