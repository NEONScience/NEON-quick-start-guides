Uncertainty in taxonomic identification is recorded in the identificationQualifier fields in each table. If identification to species is not possible, identification to a higher taxonomic rank is recorded, and indicated in the taxonRank field. The measuredBy field records the staff member who made the identification, to enable analyses of observer effects.
