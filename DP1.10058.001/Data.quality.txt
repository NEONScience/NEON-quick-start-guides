Initial quality control is implimented at the point of data entry.  Data formats are constrained and values controlled through dropdown options. Data is subjected to additional automated qualtity control assessing completeness (e.g., assessing the number of plots and subplots in the data), timeliness (e.g., was data collected when plants are best identified in the field), and plausability (e.g., are observed species documented in the region).
