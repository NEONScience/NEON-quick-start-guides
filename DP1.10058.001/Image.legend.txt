The square, multi-scale plot used to record plant species composition and cover. The plot includes nested subplots at specific locations within the plot. The 100m^2 subplot naming (e.g., 31, 32, 40, 41) corresponds to the point identification (see for point identification logic and description) in the southwest corner of the subplot. The 100m^2 subplot corners are numbered counter clockwise starting in the southwest corner. The 100m^2 subplot identifier, the subplot corner, and the scale of observation name the 1 and 10m^2 subplots. Subplot 32.2.1, for example, is the 1m^2 subplot in corner 2 of 100m^2 subplot 32.
