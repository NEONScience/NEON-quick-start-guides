The square, multi-scale plot used to record plant species composition and cover. The plot includes nested subplots at specific locations within the plot. The 100m^2 subplot naming (e.g., 31_100, 32_100, 40_100, 41_100) corresponds to the identity of the point in the southwest corner of the subplot. Smaller subplots (i.e., 1m^2 and 10m^2) are named according to the 100m^2 subplots within which they are nested, the subplot scale, and the corner of the 100m^2 subplot; corners within the 100m^2 subplot are numbered counterclockwise starting in the southwest corner. Subplot 32_1_2, for example, is the 1m^2 subplot in corner 2 of 100m^2 subplot 32_100. Prior to 2019, there were additional subplots near the center of the plot: 31_1_4, 31_10_4, 41_1_1, and 41_10_1 that were discontinued.
