Complete lists of the presence of plant species at subplots larger than 1m^2 and the 400m^2 plot scale require joining of the div_1m2Data and div_10m2Data100m2Data tables and aggregating nested subplots. This is most easily accomplished in R with the function stackPlantPresence in the neonPlants package (https://github.com/NEONScience/neonPlants). Otherwise, the Aggregation must occur according to specific nesting as described herein and in Figure 1. Prior to the 2019 and for all subsequent sampling, the nested subplots at the center of the plot were discontinued. Subplots 31_1_4, 31_10_4, 41_1_1, and 41_10_1 are no longer sampled.
