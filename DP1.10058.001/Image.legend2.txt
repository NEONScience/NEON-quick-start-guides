Complete lists of the presence of plant species at subplots larger than 1m^2 and the 400m^2 plot scale require joining of the div_1m2Data and div_10m2Data100m2Data tables and aggregating nested subplots. The Aggregation must occur according to specific nesting as described herein and in Figure 1. Prior to the 2019 and for all subsequent sampling, the nested subplots at the center of the plot were discontinued. Subplots 31.4.1, 31.4.10, 41.1.1, and 41.1.10 are no longer sampled.
