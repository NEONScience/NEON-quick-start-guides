Species-specific cover observed in 1m^2 subplots is directly available in the table div_1m2Data. Subplots at which observations were made are identified by the subplotID field (e.g., 31_1_1, 40_1_3), and are associated with specific plots (identified by the plotID field, e.g., HARV_001) within the site (Figure 1).  

Presence or incidence of species is available at 1m^2 scale and can be derived for larger subplots and the plot scale. The 1m^2 presence data is available in the table div_1m2Data with observations associated with subplots and plots as described above (Figure 1).  Data from the 10m^2 and 100m^2 subplots is available in the table div_10m2Data100m2Data. Complete lists of the presence of species at larger – 10m^2 and 100m^2 - subplots and the 400m^2 plot must be aggregated from nested subplot observations. For example, the presence of species in the 10m^2 subplot 32_10_2 must reflect observations reported at the nested 1m^2 subplot 32_1_2 and the 10m^2 subplot 32_10_2. Presence of species at the 100m^2 subplot 32_100 must aggregate species reported in all nested subplots – 32_1_2, 32_10_2, 32_1_4, 32_10_4 – and those reported in subplot 32_100 (Figure 1).

Specific subplot lists that need to be aggregated can be found in Figure 2, and additional directions for combining data across tables are included in the NEON User Guide to Plant Presence and Percent Cover data product user guide.   

The eventID field in tables div_1m2Data and div_10m2Data100m2Data can be used to match surveys representing the same sampling event.
