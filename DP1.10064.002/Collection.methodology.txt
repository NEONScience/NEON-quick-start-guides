Blood samples are collected using the submandibular method from target species in the families Cricetidae, Muridae, and Dipodidae if the individual meets criteria of good physical condition and weighs more than 10 grams. Blood samples are only collected on pathogen grids and only collected once per individual per bout. Once samples are collected, they are immediately labeled and stored on dry ice in the field and transferred to the -80 °C freezer in the laboratory. Up to 20 blood samples are collected per plotID per collectDate from the targeted families.  Ear samples are collected using a 2mm biopsy punch or iris scissors from target species once over the lifetime of an individual. Ear samples are collected on both pathogen and diversity grids during three bouts per year at each plot. Ear samples are immediately labeled and stored on dry ice in the field and transferred to the -80 °C freezer in the laboratory.
