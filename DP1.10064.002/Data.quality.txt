The sampleCondition field in the rpt2_pathogentesting table describes the condition of the sample at the time of pathogen testing. The lab quality assurance data in the rpt2_pathogenqa table, in the expanded data package contains data on controls included during PCR testing. Each plate contains a positive control to verify detection of known pathogens as well as two negative controls (one extraction control and one master mix control) to check for contamination. Samples are re-run if any controls fail. Beginning in 2021, the batchID field can be used to connect the pathogen data to the lab quality assurance data. 

Please note that quality checks are comprehensive but not exhaustive; therefore, unknown data quality issues may exist. Users are advised to evaluate quality of the data as relevant to the scientific research question being addressed, perform data review and post-processing prior to analysis, and use the data quality information and issue logs included in download packages to aid interpretation.
