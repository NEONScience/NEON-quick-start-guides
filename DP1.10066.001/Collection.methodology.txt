At each terrestrial NEON site a soil megapit is dug in the dominant soil type. Each soil pit has three vertically-oriented sampling profiles. From the surface to 1 m, a sample of soil is removed for each 10 cm depth increment. From 1 m to 2 m depth, each profile is divided into 20 cm depth increments. Roots are sieved and then sorted into two root statuses (alive or dead) and two size classes (> 2 mm and < 2 mm diameter). The megapit is sampled once during construction and represents a point in time.
