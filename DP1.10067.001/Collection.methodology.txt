Every 5 years, up to four 6.65 cm diameter x 30 cm long soil cores are collected from each plot within the tower airshed. Non-root perennial belowground biomass is not included in the sample. The cores are then wet sieved at the lab and roots are sorted by size class.  Roots >= 1 cm in length are sorted into diameter size classes, and if sufficient mass is available, are ground, dried, pooled by size class, and shipped to external laboratories for %C, %N, 13C, and 15N measurements. Roots < 1 cm in length undergo a dilution sampling technique to quantify total root fragment mass.
