Discrimination between live and dead root biomass via visual sorting contained too much uncertainty, so after 2019-05-06, all biomass has rootStatus = 'mixed'.  Additionally, size classes 0-0.5 mm and 0.5-1 mm were combined to reduce labor; a 1 mm cutoff still yields valuable information about absorptive vs. transport roots.

The sampleCondition field in the bbc_percore table describes the condition of the sample at the time of collection. Additionally, several other data quality/sample integrity fields such as biophysicalCriteria, sampleCodition, and subsampleCondition have been added to the root biomass and chemistry tables over time in order to communicate anomalous sample conditions or method deviations. A subset of samples are weighed and/or analyzed in replicate as a quality assurance check; these are indicated by the qaDryMass field in the bbc_rootmass table and the analyticalRepNumber field in the bbc_rootChemistry table. The bbc_rootChemistry table also includes quality flags applied by the analytical laboratory during processing; these are the fields ending in QF. The bgc_CNiso_externalSummary table contains the lab's ongoing quality control data, including the results of standard samples run as unknowns.

Please note that quality checks are comprehensive but not exhaustive; therefore, unknown data quality issues may exist. Users are advised to evaluate quality of the data as relevant to the scientific research question being addressed, perform data review and post-processing prior to analysis, and use the data quality information and issue logs included in download packages to aid interpretation.
