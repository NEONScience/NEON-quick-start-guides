In most cases, box traps are set in 10x10 grids in a way that one trap is set per station with 10m between each trap for a total of 100 traps. Grids are labeled from A to J and from 1 to 10 assigning each trap an individual ID (Figure 1). Traps are set at 3 to 8 plots depending on the size of the site and positioned with distributed base plots where possible.  Pathogen grids are sampled for 3 consecutive nights and diversity grids are sampled for 1 night at all sites except those that may be affected by permafrost damage.
