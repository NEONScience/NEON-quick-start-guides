Small mammals are observed at regular intervals using standard mark-recapture techniques. 100 box traps are arrayed in 10x10 grids at most sites, with one trap per station and 10 m spacing between traps. This may be modified at sites with extremely high capture rates. Grids are placed at 3 to 8 plots depending on the size of the site, and are positioned with distributed base plots where possible. Captured individuals are tagged, and may be sampled for hair, whisker, ear, blood, or fecal samples.
