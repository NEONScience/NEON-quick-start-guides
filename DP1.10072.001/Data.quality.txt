The identificationQualifier field in the mam_pertrapnight table indicates any uncertainty in the taxonomic identification of an individual. The taxonomic specificity of the identification is indicated in the taxonRank field. Users are encouraged to check data for consistency of identification over multiple captures of the same individual, and observer effects can be evaluated using the measuredBy field.
