A core is taken from three pre-determined, randomly assigned X,Y locations at 10, 40x40 NEON terrestrial base plots: four sites within the tower airshed and six distributed plots. Distributed plots are chosen using the National Land Cover Database.  Sampling is conducted once every 5 years at a site during the period of peak greenness/productivity. Soil cores are split by horizon type (organic and mineral) and collected to a maximum depth of 30 cm. The same soil cores are also sub-sampled for microbial analyses and for measurements of inorganic nitrogen transformation rates.
