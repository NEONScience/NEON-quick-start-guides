Analytical labs calibrate each run with primary reference materials, and include secondary reference materials analyzed as unknowns alongside NEON samples in order to gauge run acceptability. Labs communicate run-level issues with the accuracy of secondary reference materials, as well as record-level issues with samples or measurements using the cnPercentQF and percent AccuracyQF flags. Long-term analytical precision and accuracy of secondary reference material analyses are reported along with their uncertainty ranges in the externalSummary data table.
