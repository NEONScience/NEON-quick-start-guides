KCl-extractable inorganic N is measured on the bulk sample collected for soil microbial and biogeochemistry measurements. At the same time, in-situ covered cores (or buried bags for wetlands) are installed and incubated for 2-4 weeks, then recovered and extracted with KCl. 10 plots are sampled, with three replicates per plot. Inorganic N is measured by an external lab using standard colorimetric methods.
