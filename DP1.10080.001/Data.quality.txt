In the ntr_internalLab and ntr_externalLab tables, the field sampleCondition indicates anomolous conditions during extraction or lab analysis, respectively. In the ntr_externalLab table, the fields ammoniumNQF and nitrateNitriteNQF communicate common issues with sample or blank measurement data. As well, the dataQF field captures other, one-off types of quality issues. The expanded data package includes an external lab summary file (ntr_externalSummary) of method detection limits, precision, and accuracy for each analyte.
