Standard calculations for determining net N mineralization and net nitrification rates from inorganic N concentrations in initial and incubated cores can be found in the Appendix of the NEON User Guide to Soil inorganic nitrogen pools and transformations, included in the data package. The NEON developed function def.calc.ntrans can be used to quickly make these calculations in R (https://github.com/NEONScience/NEON-Nitrogen-Transformations).
