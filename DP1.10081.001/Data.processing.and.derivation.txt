Samples are shipped to an analytical laboratory where DNA extraction, sample library preparation and DNA sequencing of 16S and ITS marker genes occurs. See DP1.10108.001 for the raw marker gene sequence data. Sequence data are then quality-filtered and processed via a QIIME2 pipeline to generate taxonomic classification tables. See NEON.DOC.005319 for detailed description of the algorithm.
