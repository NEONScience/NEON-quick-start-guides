Community composition data are derived from marker gene sequences, which must pass basic data quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) checks, including meeting a minimum sequencing depth (e.g. number of sequences per sample), a maximum number of ambiguous base calls, and a minimum quality threshold. The specifics of the data quality criteria used may change over time as new methods become available and standards change. Within the extended download package, the table mcc_taxonTableLabSummary includes details on methods and code used by the external facility during sample processing.
