Taxonomic identification data for bacterial, archaeal, and fungal communities in soils 2014-2018. Beginning with RELEASE-2025, the algorithm was revised and this product was replaced by Soil microbe community taxonomy (DP1.10081.002). Sequencing runs from early years often did not meet criteria for the new algorithm; where data availability overlaps, we recommend using DP1.10081.002.
