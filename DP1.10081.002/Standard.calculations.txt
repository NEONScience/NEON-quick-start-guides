An R package, phyloNEON, is being developed to convert the downloaded MCT taxonomy tables to formats ready to import into existing programs for downstream analyses. Current tools on this package include functions to convert to the [BIOM format](https://biom-format.org/), which will allow for easy import into most programs (e.g. Qiime2, Mothur) for analyzing metabarcoding/amplicon sequencing data. There are also functions to import directly to the R package [Phyloseq](https://joey711.github.io/phyloseq/), one of the most popular packages to analyze amplicon sequencing data. Basic instructions to install the package and convert the downloaded data are available on the GitHub repository page (https://github.com/NEONScience/phyloNEON).

The phyloNEON package provides functions to create a basic metadata table to help the user get started. This is derived from the *mct_sampleMetadata_ITS/16S* table and includes siteID, plotID, and collectionDate. There is a wealth of NEON data that the user can explore and link to the microbe taxonomy data. For soils, a good place to start is the **Soil physical and chemical properties data product (DP1.10086.001)**, which includes soil pH, moisture, chemistry, and stable isotope data. (See Table joining section below for details on how to link the samples.)
