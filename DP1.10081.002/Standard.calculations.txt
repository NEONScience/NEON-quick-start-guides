An R package, phyloNEON, has been developed to convert the downloaded MCT taxonomy tables to a format ready to import into Phyloseq (https://joey711.github.io/phyloseq/), one of the most popular packages to analyze amplicon sequence data. Basic instructions to install the package and convert the downloaded data are available on the GitHub repository page (https://github.com/NEONScience/phyloNEON). More detailed instructions and tutorials will be released in the coming months, including converting the NEON MCT data to other popular formats (e.g. Qiime2), and add related NEON data to the sample metadata table for analysis.
