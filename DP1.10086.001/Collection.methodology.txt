A core is taken from three pre-determined, randomly assigned X,Y locations at 10, 40x40 m NEON terrestrial base plots: four sites within the tower airshed and six distributed plots. Distributed plots are chosen using the National Land Cover Database.  Sampling is conducted up to 3 times per year at most sites. Soil cores are split by horizon type and collected to a maximum depth of 30 cm. Aseptic sampling methods are used when sampling for molecular analyses. Sampling during peak greenness may include a plot-level pooled sample for microbial metaganomics.  Once every 5 years per site, inorganic nitrogen pools and C and N stable isotopes are measured.
