A core is taken from three pre-determined, randomly assigned X,Y locations at 10 40x40 m NEON terrestrial base plots: four plots within the tower airshed and six distributed plots. Sampling is conducted up to 3 times per year at most sites. Soil cores are split by horizon type and collected to a maximum depth of 30 cm. Aseptic sampling methods are used when sampling for molecular analyses. Sampling during peak greenness may include a plot-level pooled sample for microbial metagenomics. Once every 5 years per site, inorganic nitrogen pools and C, N, and their stable isotopes are measured. While this timing generally holds true, from 2026-2032 each site was actually sampled for N transformations and soil carbon and nitrogen on a 6-year interval, see data product Issue Log for more detail.
