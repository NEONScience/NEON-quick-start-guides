Quality control is implemented at the point of data entry within a mobile data entry application. Numerous quality flagging fields exist for field staff to note issues related to horizon identification and sample integrity, among others: the full list of quality flagging fields and potential values is provided in the Data Product User Guide. Additional constraints are implemented during automated ingest to the NEON database. The dataQF field is used to flag data quality issues manually discovered after data submission.
