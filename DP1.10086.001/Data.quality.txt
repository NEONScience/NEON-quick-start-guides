For the sls_soilCoreCollection table, the field biophysicalCriteria describes whether the target biophysical criteria for a sample was met, any unusual observations about a soil horizon are noted in the horizonDetails field, and any non-standard preparation methods (prepMethod fields) or cold chain issues (condition fields) related to the microbial samples are noted. For nitrogen transformations samples, the field incubationCondition records any anomalous conditions upon retrieving incubated samples. For the sls_soilMoisture, sls_metagenomicsPooling, and sls_bgcSubsampling tables, sampleCondition fields note anomalous conditions during laboratory processing or storage for these sample types.

For the sls_soilChemistry table, analytical labs calibrate each run with primary reference materials, and include secondary reference materials analyzed as unknowns alongside NEON samples in order to gauge run acceptability. Labs communicate run-level issues with the accuracy of secondary reference materials, as well as record-level issues with samples or measurements, using the quality flag fields ending in QF. Long-term analytical precision and accuracy of secondary reference material analyses are reported along with their uncertainty ranges in the bgc_CNiso_externalSummary data table.

For the nitrogen transformations data, in the ntr_internalLab and ntr_externalLab tables, the field sampleCondition indicates anomalous conditions during extraction or lab analysis, respectively. In the ntr_externalLab table, the fields ammoniumNQF and nitrateNitriteNQF communicate common issues with sample or blank measurement data. As well, the dataQF field captures other, one-off types of quality issues. The expanded data package includes an external lab summary file (ntr_externalSummary) of method detection limits, precision, and accuracy for each analyte.
