The same testingID is tested for multiple pathogens. Data return also reports rows for all possible pathogens, even those that were not tested for a given sample. If testResult is blank, that pathogen was not tested for in that sample of tick species. Thus, this means when calculating the denominator (number tested) for prevalence, the results must be filtered by testPathogenName and testResult must not be blank.
