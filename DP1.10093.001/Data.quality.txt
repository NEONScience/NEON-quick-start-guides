The sampleCondition field in each data table indicates the condition of the sample at each stage in collection and identification. The identificationQualifier field in the taxonomic tables indicates uncertainty in the taxonomic identification, and the taxonRank field notes the specificity of the identification. The identifiedBy field is provided to identify the taxonomist, and enable evaluation of observer effects.
