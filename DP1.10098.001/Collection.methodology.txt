Taxonomic identification, stem diameter, height, crown dimensions, observations of plant health and mapped location information and other measurements are recorded to enable estimation of biomass and production at multiple scales according to established allometries for the growth forms present across the NEON observatory. Data are collected with hand-held tools in the field, using standardized methods adopted from the forestry community. The temporal strategy is plot dependent; tower plots are measured annually and overlap with instrument based measurement of productivity from the surface-atmosphere exchange system, while distributed plots are measured less frequently and provide a biomass snapshot across all vegetation types within a given NEON site.
