The identificationQualifier field indicates uncertainty in taxonomic identification, and the taxonRank field indicates the specificity of the identification. For individuals monitored via dendrometer bands, the dendrometerCondition field indicates any problems with the band at the time of data collection.

For analyses that rely on precise geolocation of individuals, the coordinateUncertainty field in the vst_mappingandtagging table contains the uncertainty at the plot level; i.e., it reflects that each measurement was made somewhere within the plot. To calculate the location and uncertainty for each mapped individual, follow the instructions in the User Guide or use the 'getLocVSTmapped' function in the geoNEON R package to perform the calculations. https://github.com/NEONScience/NEON-geolocation. To locate unmapped individuals at spatial scales finer than the plot, use the subplotID in the vst_apparentindividual or vst_non-woody tables and follow the instructions in the User Guide or use the 'getLocVSTsubplots' function in the geoNEON R package.

Please note that quality checks are comprehensive but not exhaustive; therefore, unknown data quality issues may exist. Users are advised to evaluate quality of the data as relevant to the scientific research question being addressed, perform data review and post-processing prior to analysis, and use the data quality information and issue logs included in download packages to aid interpretation.
