Woody vegetation measurements are designed for use in estimating plant biomass and productivity at NEON sites. Published allometries for plant biomass as it relates to height, stem diameter, taxonomic identification, and other measurements should be used to make these estimates.

To extrapolate from individual plants to the plot or site level, adjustment should be made for the plot-specific use of nested subplots (for smaller growth forms), and the distribution of measured plants across the site as a whole. The nlcdClass field in the vst_perplotperyear table indicates the National Land Cover Database class of each plot, and the vst_perplotperyear table also contains the results of the annual survey of candidate plots to determine the presence or absence of relevant plant types in each plot.

Other data products measuring components of biomass and productivity include Non-herbaceous perennial vegetation structure (DP1.10045.001; bundled with this product from RELEASE-2022 onward), Litterfall and fine woody debris (NEON.DP1.10033), herbaceous clip harvest (NEON.DP1.10023), root biomass and chemistry (DP1.10067), coarse downed wood log surveys (NEON.DP1.10010), and coarse downed wood bulk density (NEON.DP1.10014).

Woody vegetation measurements can also be used as ground references for NEON remote sensing data. To calculate the location of each mapped individual, follow the instructions in the User Guide, or use the geoNEON R package to perform the calculations. https://github.com/NEONScience/NEON-geolocation
