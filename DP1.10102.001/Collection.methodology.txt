Depending on the stature of the site vegetation either 20 or 30 plots are sampled from the tower air shed only.  one of two o.5x3m clip cells are randomly chose per plot.  A 30cm deep core is taken from both the north and the south ends of the clip cell.  The core is sieved to remove soil, the root matter is then sorted into 4 class sized, dryed, and weighted.  Live root material is sent to an external laboratory for nitrogen and stable isotope analyses.
