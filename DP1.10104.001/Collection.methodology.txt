Microbial biomass is a subset of the homogenized sample collected as part of the soil microbial and biogeochemistry field sampling protocol. Bulk soil is stored on ice packs in the field and processed at the NEON field laboratory within 24 hours. The field-moist soil is sieved and/or non-soil material is removed, and a representative subsample is transferred to a vial and stored in an ultra-low freezer. Samples are shipped to an external lab where analysis occurs.
