In the sme_scaledMicrobialBiomass and sme_microbialBiomass tables, sample-level issues such as lipids out of the range of instrument calibration or low/high recovery of the internal standard, along with run-level issues such as quality assurance materials not meeting acceptance criteria, are reported in the field analysisResultsQF. In sme_batchResults, issues with quality assurance materials (QA standards or analytical blanks) not meeting acceptance criteria are reported in the field analyteStandardQF. Other known issues may be reported in the dataQF field for affected records. 

The high-througput PLFA method used by NEON has a known issue with c18:0 contamination from solid phase extraction plates. When this lipid is reported in the data, users should consider correcting for blank contamination using results from the sme_batchResults table, or excluding this column from total lipid calculations.
