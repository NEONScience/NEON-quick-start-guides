Raw data are converted by the analytical laboratory into lipid concentrations using a calibration standard, and extraction efficiencies are determined for each sample using a spiked internal standard. Uncorrected concentrations are reported along with extraction efficiencies for users to adjust lipid values based on sample extraction efficiency. Total lipid concentrations are calculated during NEON automated data ingest by adding all reported lipid concentrations; the number of lipids and extract types of lipids may change over time and may affect total calculated lipid concentrations.
