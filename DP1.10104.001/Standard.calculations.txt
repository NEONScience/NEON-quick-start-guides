Raw data are converted by the analytical laboratory into lipid concentrations using an instrument calibration standard and results from an internal standard spiked with each sample. Prior to November 1, 2021, extraction efficiencies were determined for each sample using the spiked internal standard, and unscaled concentrations were reported along with extraction efficiencies in sme_microbialBiomass for users to adjust lipid values based on sample extraction efficiency. Starting November 1, 2021 and onwared, scaled concentrations are reported in sme_scaledMicrobialBiomass, and extraction efficiency is not reported but the recovery of the internal standard in raw GC units is provided. When QA criteria are met, data collected prior to Novembmer 1, 2021 are also presented in this table. Total lipid concentrations are calculated during NEON automated data ingest by adding all reported lipid concentrations; the number of lipids and extract types of lipids may change over time and may affect total calculated lipid concentrations.
