Samples are collected and sub-sampled in the field by horizon type (organic and mineral) to a maximum depth of 30 cm, and are pooled at the plot level. Samples are frozen on dry ice in the field and stored in ultralow freezers until they are shipped to an external laboratory for analysis of microbial community structure and functional potential using shotgun metagenomics.
