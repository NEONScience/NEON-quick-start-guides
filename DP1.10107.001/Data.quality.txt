Samples must achieve a minimum number of sequences of sufficient quality in order to pass QAQC. Samples must also pass QAQC checks during the various processing steps. Samples that do not meet these QAQC criteria will be notes as "Fail" in the qaqcStatus fields in the respective data tables, or may include additional quality flags.
