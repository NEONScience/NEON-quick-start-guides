All tables in this data product can be joined by the dnaSampleID. When joining the mmg_soilMarkerGeneSequencing_16S and _ITS tables and the mmg_soilRawDataFiles tables, use the dnaSampleID x targetGene to distinguish 16S and ITS records. The marker genes tables can be joined among other soil collection data by linking the geneticSampleID in table mmg_soilDnaExtraction to the geneticSampleID in table sls_soilCoreCollection of the Soil Physical Properties data product, and from there finding the associated sampleID to link to other soil analyses. Soil microbe community composition and Soil microbe group abundance data can be linked with this product using the dnaSampleID field.
