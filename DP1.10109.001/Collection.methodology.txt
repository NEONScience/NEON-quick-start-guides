Samples are collected and sub-sampled in the field by horizon type (organic and mineral) to a maximum depth of 30 cm, and are frozen on dry ice in the field. After intermediate storage in ultra-low temperature freezers, they are shipped to an external laboratory which uses two targeted Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) analysis runs to produce the abundance estimates for: 1) bacteria and archaea, 2) fungi.
