As much as possible, soil microbe group abundance data follows the Minimum Information of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments (MIQE) metadata and data quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) guidelines. Batch-level quality control outcomes and long-term analytical standards and performance data can be found in the mga_batchResults and mga_labSummary tables, in the expanded data package.

Please note that quality checks are comprehensive but not exhaustive; therefore, unknown data quality issues may exist. Users are advised to evaluate quality of the data as relevant to the scientific research question being addressed, perform data review and post-processing prior to analysis, and use the data quality information and issue logs included in download packages to aid interpretation.
