Information about management and disturbance events necessarily is somewhat qualitative. In some cases, events recorded here provide explanation and context for data that could not be collected; in other cases, data collection is still possible, but events recorded here may influence data. Cross-reference these events with the data products and locations used in your work, and evaluate whether your analyses need adjustment.
