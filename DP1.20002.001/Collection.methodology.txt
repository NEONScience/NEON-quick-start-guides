A fixed camera is deployed at all NEON aquatic sites to capture the physical interface between terrestrial vegetation and the aquatic system. Cameras are typically positioned to also capture the staff gauge.  Images are collected every 15 minutes and sent to and processed by the PhenoCam Network, a cooperative network that archives and distributes imagery and derived data products from digital cameras deployed at research sites across North America and around the world.
