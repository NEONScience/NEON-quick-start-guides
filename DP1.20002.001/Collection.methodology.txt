A fixed Stardot NetCam camera is deployed at all NEON aquatic sites to capture the physical interface between terrestrial vegetation and the aquatic system. Cameras are typically positioned to also capture the staff gauge. Every 15 minutes each camera captures back-to-back RGB and IR images separated by 30 seconds. Images are directly transmitted the PhenoCam Network, a cooperative network that archives and distributes imagery and derived data products from digital cameras deployed at research sites across North America and around the world.
