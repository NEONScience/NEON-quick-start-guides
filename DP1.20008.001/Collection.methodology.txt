Conductivity of surface water is measured using balanced 4-electrode cell conductivity sensors on vented pressure transducers.  Measurements are taken at upstream and downstream sensor sets at select wadeable stream sites and at littoral sensor sets at lake sites.  Measurements spatially represent a point and are made at 0.0167 Hz (1 per minute). Data are published as five- and thirty-minute specific conductance averages.
