Conductivity of groundwater is measured using vented pressure transducers in up to 8 groundwater wells at wadeable stream, river, and lake sites. Data from each well will be sent to the Aquatic Portal for ingest through wireless data transmission. Measurements spatially represent a point and are made at 0.00333 Hz (every 5 minutes). Data are published as instantaneous five-minute readings and thirty-minute averages.
