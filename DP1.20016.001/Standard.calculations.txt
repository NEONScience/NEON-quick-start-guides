Latitude, longitude (referenceLatitude, referenceLongitude; Â°), elevation (referenceElevation; m), and sensor position relative to the reference elevation of the water level sensor (zOffset; m) are in the sensor positions file (...sensor_positions...csv).
 Use the HOR.VER component of the time series file name to link to the corresponding row in the HOR.VER column of the sensor positions file. An HOR of 101 or 131 correspond to Sensor Set 1 (upstream) and an HOR of 102 or 132 correspond to Sensor Set 2 (downstream).  An HOR of 110 indicates sensors mounted on a staff gage.  HORs of 130 and 140 correspond to littoral zones, 150 to inflow and 160 to outflow of lakes.
