The net radiometer consists of two pairs of pyranometers and pyrgeometers facing upwards and downwards. The upward facing sensors measure incoming shortwave and longwave solar radiation and the downward facing sensors measure outgoing radiation reflected from the earth's surface. Net radiation on buoys is measured at a frequency of 1/30 Hz, spatially represents a point, and data are published as 1-minute and 30-minute averages of incoming and outgoing shortwave and longwave radiation.
