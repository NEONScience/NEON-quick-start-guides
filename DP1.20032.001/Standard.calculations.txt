Sensor height (zOffset; m) and the latitude, longitude (referenceLatitude, referenceLongitude; Â°), and elevation (m) of the buoy are in the sensor positions file (...sensor_positions...csv). Use the HOR.VER component of the time series file name (horizontalPosition and verticalPosition if stacked using neonUtilities) to link to the corresponding row in the HOR.VER column of the sensor positions file. HOR index 103 corresponds to the buoy, and VER index 100 corresponds to the sensor location on the buoy.
