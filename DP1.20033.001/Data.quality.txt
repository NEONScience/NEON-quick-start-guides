Each measurement is accompanied by a final quality flag ("...FinalQF"). NEON recommends only using data where the corresponding final quality flag is 0. Data with a final quality flag of 1 are potentially inaccurate and should only be used with caution. The final quality flag is based on automated QA/QC tests, including range, gap, and spike tests, as well as a manually set science review flag if applicable ("...FinalQFSciRvw"). Each measurement is accompanied by an estimate of measurement uncertainty, expressed at the 95% confidence level ("...ExpUncert"), which comprises known and quantifiable uncertainties. In addition, automated flags are applied when sensor lamp temperature and internal humidity are out of acceptable range; see variables file and ATBD for details on these flags.
