Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) is measured using an upward-facing radiation sensor located atop the in-stream infrastructure, above the surface of the water at both sensor sets at stream sites. PAR above water surface is measured from a buoy deployment at lake and river sites. The exact height of the sensor is determined on a site-specific basis. Measurements represent a point, are made at 1 Hz, and data are published in 1, 5, and 30 minute averaging intervals.
