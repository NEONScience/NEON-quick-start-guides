At stream sites, permanent discharge transects are located near sensor set 1 (S1) or sensor set 2 (S2) on a riffle or a run. A meter tape, wading rod, and velocity meter are used to collect point velocity and depth measurements across the stream with the goal of 20-25 evenly spaces measurements for streams with a width of more than 2m. The minimum distance between points is 0.05m regardless of stream width.  Staff gauge height is recorded before and after each discharge measurement in order to build the stage-discharge rating curve.
