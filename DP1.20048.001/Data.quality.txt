The lowVelocityQF field in the dsc_individualFieldData table indicates the water velocity at an individual point measurement was below the instrument detection limit (1 = point measurment flagged as being below detection limit). The lowVelocityFinalQF in the dsc_fieldData table reports the percent of dsc_individualFieldData:lowVelocityQF = 1 across the entire discharge transect for a given measurement. The estimated95percentUC field in the dsc_fieldDataADCP table reports the estimated ninety-five percent uncertainty of the total discharge measurement as calculated by the post-processing software.
