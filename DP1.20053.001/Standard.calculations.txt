Sensor depth (zOffset; m) and the latitude, longitude (referenceLatitude, referenceLongitude; Â°), and elevation (referenceElevation; m) of the PRT sensor are in the sensor positions file (...sensor_positions...csv). Use the HOR.VER component of the time series file name to link to the corresponding row in the HOR.VER column of the sensor positions file. An HOR of 101 or 111 correspond to Sensor Set 1 (upstream) and HOR of 102 or 112 correspond to Sensor Set 2 (downstream).
