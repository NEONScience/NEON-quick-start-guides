Temperature (digital thermistor) of surface water is measured using temperature sensors on vented pressure transducers.  Measurements are taken at upstream and downstream sensor sets at wadeable stream sites, on infrastructure near buoys at river sites, and littoral sensor sets at lake sites.  Measurements spatially represent a point and are made at 0.0167 Hz (1 per minute). Data are published as five- and thirty-minute temperature averages.
