Temperature and specific conductance are measured at specific depths, which are monitored via a pressure transducer. Sensor depth relative to the water surface (changes as water levels change) are reported along with sensor height realtive to the anchor (only changes when the mooring cable is modified). The subsurface mooring enables continuous winter monitoring beneath ice at lake sites that freeze. During the summer or at lakes that don't freeze, the subsurface mooring enables better coverage of the water column than the surface moored temperature chain alone (see Temperature at specific depth in surface water, DP1.20264.001).
