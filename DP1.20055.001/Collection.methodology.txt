Temperature and specific conductance are measured at specific depths, which are monitored via a pressure transducer. The subsurface (lake bed anchored) mooring enables better coverage of the water column than the surface moored buoy temperature chain alone (see Temperature at specific depth in surface water, DP1.20264.001). In addition, the subsurface mooring enables continuous winter monitoring beneath ice at lake sites that freeze, since buoys are removed during the winter season. Sensor depth relative to the water surface is reported along with sensor height relative to the anchor (constant except when the mooring cable is modified, see image).
