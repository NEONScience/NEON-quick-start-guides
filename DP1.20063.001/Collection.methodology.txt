Aquatic plant, bryophyte, and macroalgae samples are collected by clip harvest once a year during the bout 2 aquatic sampling window. Ten samples are collected per site if aquatic vegetation is present. In wadeable streams collections are made within 4 meters of the nearest plant transect; 5 samples are collected from within the dominant habitat type and 5 samples are collected from the sub-dominant habitat type. The ten sampling points for lakes and rivers are determined by random GPS points from depth ranges where vegetation is known to colonize. Samples are separated by taxon at the domain lab, identified, ground, and shipped to the contracting laboratory for chemical analysis.
