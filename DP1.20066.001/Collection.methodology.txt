Clip harvest data are collected from 10 locations at all aquatic sites during bout 2 of the biological and sediment chemistry bouts (mid-summer). In lakes and rivers, additional presence/absence data are collected from 10 points during bouts 1 and 3. Points in lakes and rivers use randomized point sampling, and plant samples are collected using a submerged rake along three-1.5 m tows. Clip harvest data are collected near permanent transects using a 0.25 m2 (or 0.01 m2) quadrat. In wadeable streams, five of these collections are in the dominant habitat type and five are from the sub-dominant habitat type spaced >10m apart.
