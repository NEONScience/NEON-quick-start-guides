Data quality is checked at multiple points from time of data entry to the time it is available on the NEON data portal. Dropdown options and format constraints are used to ensure data are entered into the mobile application accurately across domains. Flagged data are denoted by "dataQF" signifying data was recorded using paper rather than digital data entry. Two external taxonomists cross check ten percent of all samples to ensure positive taxonomic identification, these samples are denoted by "qcTaxonomyStatus." All data are reviewed before being loaded to the data portal. Major errors or revisions are readily available to users in the Change Log section of the 'readme' document that accompanies all data downloads.
