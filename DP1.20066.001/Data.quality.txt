Ten percent of samples are cross checked by two expert taxonomists to ensure accuracy in taxonomic identification. These samples are denoted by the qcTaxonomyStatus field in the apl_taxonomyRaw and apl_taxonomyProcessed tables. The identificationQualifier field notes uncertainty in the identification, and the taxonRank field notes the specificity of the identification.
