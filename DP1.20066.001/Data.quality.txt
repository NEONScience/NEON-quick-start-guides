Ten percent of samples are cross checked by two expert taxonomists to ensure accuracy in taxonomic identification. These samples are denoted by the qcTaxonomyStatus field in the apl_taxonomyRaw and apl_taxonomyProcessed tables. The identificationQualifier field notes uncertainty in the identification, and the taxonRank field notes the specificity of the identification.

Please note that quality checks are comprehensive but not exhaustive; therefore, unknown data quality issues may exist. Users are advised to evaluate quality of the data as relevant to the scientific research question being addressed, perform data review and post-processing prior to analysis, and use the data quality information and issue logs included in download packages to aid interpretation.
