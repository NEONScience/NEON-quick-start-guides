Sampling is conducted three times per year during the aquatic biology bout windows (spring, summer, and fall) at each of the 10 permanently-marked plant transects along the reach.  A minimum of 20 points along the wetted width of each transect is sampled using a view bucket. If target taxa is present each of the  groups present is recorded. If no target taxa are present then the substratum of the location is recorded by size class. Samples will be collected for taxonomic analysis by an external facility at each transect if they cannot be identified in the field.
