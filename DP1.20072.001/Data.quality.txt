Uncertainty in taxonomic identification is indicated by the identificationQualifier field. Taxa that can't be identified in the field are sent for expert identification, as indicated by the expertIdentificationRequired field. Expert identifications can be found in the apc\_taxonomyRaw and apc\taxonomyProcessed tables. Use the sampleID field to match taxa in the apc_perTaxon table to the expert identifications. Note that there may be multiple records for a given sampleID in the apc\_taxonomyRaw and apc\taxonomyProcessed tables, because in some cases an expert may find that multiple taxa have been sent for identification in a single sample.

Please note that quality checks are comprehensive but not exhaustive; therefore, unknown data quality issues may exist. Users are advised to evaluate quality of the data as relevant to the scientific research question being addressed, perform data review and post-processing prior to analysis, and use the data quality information and issue logs included in download packages to aid interpretation.
