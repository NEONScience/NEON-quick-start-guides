Uncertainty in taxonomic identification is indicated by the identificationQualifier field. Taxa that can't be identified in the field are sent for expert identification, as indicated by the expertIdentificationRequired field. Expert identifications can be found in the apc\_taxonomyRaw and apc\taxonomyProcessed tables. Use the sampleID field to match taxa in the apc_perTaxon table to the expert identifications. Note that there may be multiple records for a given sampleID in the apc\_taxonomyRaw and apc\taxonomyProcessed tables, because in some cases an expert may find that multiple taxa have been sent for identification in a single sample.
