Taxonomic identification data for bacterial, archaeal, and fungal communities in benthic sediments 2014-2018. Beginning with RELEASE-2025, the algorithm was revised and this product was replaced by Benthic microbe community taxonomy (DP1.20086.002). Sequencing runs from early years often did not meet criteria for the new algorithm; where data availability overlaps, we recommend using DP1.20086.002.
