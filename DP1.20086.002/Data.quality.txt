Community taxonomy data are derived from marker gene sequences, which must pass basic data quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) checks, including meeting a minimum sequencing depth (e.g. number of sequences per sample), a maximum number of ambiguous base calls, and a minimum quality threshold. The specifics of the data quality criteria used may change over time as new methods become available and standards change. Within the expanded download package, the table mct_taxonTableLabSummary includes details on methods and code used by the external facility during sample processing. 

The number of sequences can vary a great deal across samples, and this is reflected in the number of OTUs assigned to any sample, and the frequency of each OTU for that sample. This variation can affect comparisons between samples, especially for ecological diversity measurements. The best data quality measure to account for this will be the `sampleFilteredReadNumber` field in the *mct_sampleMetadata_ITS/16S* table. Users can filter out samples with very low read numbers to improve some diversity assessments.

Please note that quality checks are comprehensive but not exhaustive; therefore, unknown data quality issues may exist. Users are advised to evaluate quality of the data as relevant to the scientific research question being addressed, perform data review and post-processing prior to analysis, and use the data quality information and issue logs included in download packages to aid interpretation.
