Most aquatic sites have up to eight shallow (<100 ft depth) groundwater observation wells on the perimeter of sampled waterbodies (Fig 1). Groundwater chemistry samples are collected from a subset of three to four wells at each site. Samples are typically collected via groundwater pump or bailer tube and specific methodology can vary based on site conditions. A more detailed description can be found in the AOS Protocol and Procedure: Water Chemistry Sampling in Surface Waters in Groundwater (NEON.DOC.002905). Samples are filtered at the time of collection and are kept cold then shipped overnight to the external laboratory or processed in the Domain Support Facility for alkalinity processing.
