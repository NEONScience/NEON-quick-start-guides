Data on conditions during sampling can be found in the gwc_fieldSuperParent table, including water depth in the wells, sampling methodology, and volume of water purged. The gwc_wellStabilization table provides data about stabilization of water in the well associated with sampling. The sampleCondition field in the gwc_externalLabDataByAnalyte table provides information about the condition of the sample at the time of analysis. The swc_externalLabSummaryData table provides data about long-term performance of the analytical laboratory, including method detection limits, precision, and uncertainty.
