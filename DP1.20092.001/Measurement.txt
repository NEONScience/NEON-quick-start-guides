Alkalinity and in situ field parameters (pH, specific conductance, water temperature, and dissolved oxygen) are measured by NEON technicians. External laboratories provide chemical data for anions, cations, conductivity, pH, and various forms of carbon and nutrients including total, dissolved and particulates.
