Wadeable stream water collection occurs in the thalweg near the downstream sensor set while non-wadeable streams sample from a depth of 0.5m. Samples are taken up to 26 times per year (Fig 1). Lakes are sampled at up to 3 locations with variable depths near the bouy, inlet and outlet sensors 12 times per year (Fig 1). A more detailed description can be found in the AOS Protocol and Procedure: Water Chemistry Sampling in Surface Waters in Groundwater (NEON.DOC.002905). Samples are filtered within 3 hours of collection, kept cold, then shipped overnight to an analytical laboratory for processing.
