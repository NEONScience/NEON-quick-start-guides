Water subsamples for dissolved gas analysis are collected in syringes. A known volume of water is equilibrated with a known volume of air by shaking the syringe for 5 minutes. An ambient reference air sample is also collected. Equilibrated and reference air samples are injected into evacuated gas vials and sent to an external laboratory for analysis of dissolved gas concentrations. For streams, sampling occurs up to 26 times per year, approximately every other week but guided by historical stream discharge patterns. Lakes are sampled 12 times per year, approximately monthly and during shoulder seasons to capture ice-on/ice-off and lake turnover events.
