At the three aquatic permafrost sites, 8 shallow groundwater wells (screened-slotted PVC) are installed per site at inter-tussock locations surrounding the lake or stream reach. Each week, during the thaw season, the wells are pushed down to thaw depth. The distance to the frozen interface, to liquid water (if present), and to the ground surface from the top of the well casing are measured using a water level meter. A thaw probe is used to take 10 additional measurments of thaw depth from the ground surface from the 2m radius surrounding each well. Wells are removed at the end of the season, as they begin to freeze, and are replaced by a PVC plug.
