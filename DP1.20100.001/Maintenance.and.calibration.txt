Sensors are calibrated prior to installation at field sites and recalibrated on an annual basis. Water level sensors are only removed from their measurement location for quarterly maintenance and on an as-needed basis to ensure data quality. Groundwater clarity checks are conducted on a quarterly basis and wells are redeveloped when necessary.
