All fish from which DNA samples were collected have an accompanying photo that is taken before sample collection.  AQUI-SÂ®20E (10% eugenol) is used to anesthetize the fish in order to collect fin clips for DNA. Fin clips are collected from pelvic or caudal fins and should range in size from 2mm to 5mm in diameter depending on the size of the fish. The sample is stored in 70% or greater ethanol and scissors are flame sterilized before and after each collection. Every year, up to five tissue specimens are collected from each species per site. Based on current levels of fish diversity at NEON sites, between 475 and 570 individuals receive DNA barcoding annually.
