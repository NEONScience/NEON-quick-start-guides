In accordance with BOLD requirements, sequence metadata on the NEON portal correspond to the metadata fields on the BOLD website. COI sequences are quality checked by the analytical facility and BOLD, sequences deemed as high quality are those with more than 500 base pairs, less than 1% ambiguous bases and no stop codon/contamination flags. Sequences deemed low quality are flagged for stop codons or contamination. Contamination is defined as having double peaks at almost every base position.
