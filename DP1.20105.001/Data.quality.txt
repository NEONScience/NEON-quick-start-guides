In accordance with BOLD requirements, sequence metadata on the NEON portal correspond to the metadata fields on the BOLD website. COI sequences are quality checked by the analytical facility and BOLD, sequences deemed as high quality are those with more than 500 base pairs, less than 1% ambiguous bases and no stop codon/contamination flags. Sequences deemed low quality are flagged for stop codons or contamination. Contamination is defined as having double peaks at almost every base position.

Please note that quality checks are comprehensive but not exhaustive; therefore, unknown data quality issues may exist. Users are advised to evaluate quality of the data as relevant to the scientific research question being addressed, perform data review and post-processing prior to analysis, and use the data quality information and issue logs included in download packages to aid interpretation.
