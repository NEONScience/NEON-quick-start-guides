Each NEON aquatic stream site as 10 designated reaches measuring between 80m and 120m. Of these 10 reaches, 3 are “fixed” meaning they are sampled twice every year. Fixed reaches are sampled using a three-pass electrofishing depletion strategy. The remaining 7 reaches are rotated through and are sampled using single pass. Lake sites are similar but instead use a segmented approach to capture nearshore and offshore populations. These segments are located between two riparian transects and they all meet in the center of the lake. The fixed segments of lakes include habitat features that best represent the lake and include one fyke net and one gill net set. At both streams and lakes the same random reaches/segments are sampled in spring and fall and rotate to a new set each year. One full sampling bout will contain the 3 fixed reaches and 3 random reaches for a total of 6.
