Data quality measures begin at the point of data entry. By constraining formats and controlling values with dropdown menus NEON reduced the number of steps to process raw data. Data are processed using automated methods. These are outlined in the NEON Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document: OS Generic Transitions. A more specific description of constrained can be found in the NEON Raw Data Validation for Fish electrofishing, gill netting, and fyke netting counts document (NEON.DP0.20107) which is provided as an additional download with this data product.
