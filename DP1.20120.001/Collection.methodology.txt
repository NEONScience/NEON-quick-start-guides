Benthic macroinvertebrates are collected three times annually (roughly spring, summer and fall) at 24 wadeable stream sites, 7 lake sites and 3 river sites. Macroinvertebrate collection methods vary by site type, habitat types, and available substratum. All samples are collected from the surface of the natural substratum in each habitat using a quantitative sampling method. Macroinvertebrate samples are preserved with ethanol in the field and sent to a taxonomy lab for sorting, identification, and enumeration.
