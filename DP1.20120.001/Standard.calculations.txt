Standard calculations for benthic invertebrate data include standardizing the 'estimatedTotalCount' per sample, which takes subsampling into account, reported in the inv_taxonomyProcessed table to abundance per benthic area. To calculate quantitative results, divide by 'benthicArea' reported in the inv_fieldData table to get the number of organisms per square meter of stream, lake, or river bottom. All taxon records from a sample should be summed and divided by the 'benthicArea' prior to reporting the total abundance per m2. For biomass per m2, the estimated abundace calculated above can be used in conjunction with length/mass relationships in published literature.
