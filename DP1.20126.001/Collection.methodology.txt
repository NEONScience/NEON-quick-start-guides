Benthic macroinvertebrate DNA samples are collected three times annually (roughly spring, summer and fall) at 24 wadeable stream sites, 7 lake sites and 3 river sites. Samples are collected from the surface of the natural substratum in each habitat using the quantitative sampling method most suitable for the site. Samples collected during the second sampling bout are sent to an analytical laboratory where sample homogenization, DNA extraction, sequencing library preparation, and DNA sequencing occur. Samples from the first and third bout are stored in the NEON biorepository and are not processed.
