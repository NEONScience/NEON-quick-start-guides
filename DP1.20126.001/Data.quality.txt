Each metadata table from the external analytcal facility includes a variable, called qaqcStatus, in which the laboratory can indicate sample processing issues. Any records with a qaqcStatus = “Fail” should also be accompanied by free-form notes in the “remarks” variable. The fields sampleFilteredReadNumber and averageFilteredReadQuality also indicate data quality in in inv_markerGeneSequencing table. An aliquot of the community standard sample (inv_dnaStandardTaxon) is analyzed with with each sequencing run as a positive control, and can be compared over time. 

Please note that quality checks are comprehensive but not exhaustive; therefore, unknown data quality issues may exist. Users are advised to evaluate quality of the data as relevant to the scientific research question being addressed, perform data review and post-processing prior to analysis, and use the data quality information and issue logs included in download packages to aid interpretation.
