Each metadata table from the external analytcal facility includes a variable, called qaqcStatus, in which the laboratory can indicate sample processing issues. Any records with a qaqcStatus = “Fail” should also be accompanied by free-form notes in the “remarks” variable. The fields sampleFilteredReadNumber and averageFilteredReadQuality also indicate data quality in in inv_markerGeneSequencing table. An aliquot of the community standard sample (inv_dnaStandardTaxon) is analyzed with with each sequencing run as a positive control, and can be compared over time.
