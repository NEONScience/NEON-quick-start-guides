Ten percent of all samples at the external laboratory are quality checked for percent difference (PDE) in enumeration by two expert analysts. If PDE is <5% the record is accepted, if PDE is >5% a third analyst will count the sample and any analytical issues will be resolved prior to data return. Records that have received this quality check will be marked by fields qaqcStatus and enumerationDifference. Additional details on the external lab quality checks can be found in the external lab SOP.

Please note that quality checks are comprehensive but not exhaustive; therefore, unknown data quality issues may exist. Users are advised to evaluate quality of the data as relevant to the scientific research question being addressed, perform data review and post-processing prior to analysis, and use the data quality information and issue logs included in download packages to aid interpretation.
