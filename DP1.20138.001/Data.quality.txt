Ten percent of all samples at the external laboratory are quality checked for percent difference (PDE) in enumeration by two expert analysts. If PDE is <5% the record is accepted, if PDE is >5% a third analyst will count the sample and any analytical issues will be resolved prior to data return. Records that have received this quality check will be marked by fields qaqcStatus and enumerationDifference. Additional details on the external lab quality checks can be found in the external lab SOP.
