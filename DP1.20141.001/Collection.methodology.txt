Surface water microbe samples are usually collected in tandem with one or more of the other bulk water sampling protocols (chemistry, isotopes, and dissolved gases). Once samples are collected and frozen they are shipped to an external facility for processing. The 16S ribosomal RNA gene is targeted to measure bacteria and archaea while the internally-transcribed spacer (ITS) region is used to measure fungi.
