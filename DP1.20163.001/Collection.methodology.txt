Algae are collected three times per year at all NEON aquatic sites. Depending on the habitat type at each location, algae samples may be collected from cobbles (epilithon), silt (epipelon), sand (epipsammon) woody debris (epixylon), or plant surfaces (epiphyton) in addition to the seston and phytoplankton collected from the water column. Samples are processed at the Domain Support Facility within 24 hours of collection, where samples are filtered on GF/F filters for chlorphyll a and pheophytin, C, N, P, and C, N, S isotopes. Chlorophyll/pheophytin samples are frozen and filters for the remaining analytes are dried. All filters are shipped to an external laboratory for analysis.
