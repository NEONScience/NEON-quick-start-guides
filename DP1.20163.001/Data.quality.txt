All suites of algal chemistry contain 1 lab replicate filter per analyte, where 1 field sample has been selected at random to be duplicated for chlorophyll/pheophytin, C, N, P, and C, N, S isotopes. Algal chemistry filters are shipped to the analytical lab with 2 blank filters per shipment that have been treated like a typical sample filter in the lab and rinsed only with DI water. Quality data are reported in the asi_externalLabPOMSummaryData table.
