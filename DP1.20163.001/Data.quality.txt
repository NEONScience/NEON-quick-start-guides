All suites of algal chemistry contain 1 lab replicate filter per analyte, where 1 field sample has been selected at random to be duplicated for chlorophyll/pheophytin, C, N, P, and C, N, S isotopes. Algal chemistry filters are shipped to the analytical lab with 2 blank filters per shipment that have been treated like a typical sample filter in the lab and rinsed only with DI water. Quality data are reported in the asi_externalLabPOMSummaryData table.

Please note that quality checks are comprehensive but not exhaustive; therefore, unknown data quality issues may exist. Users are advised to evaluate quality of the data as relevant to the scientific research question being addressed, perform data review and post-processing prior to analysis, and use the data quality information and issue logs included in download packages to aid interpretation.
