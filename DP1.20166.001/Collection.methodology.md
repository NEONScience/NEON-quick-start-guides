Samples are collected at 24 wadeable stream sites, 7 lake sites, and 3 river sites. Samples are collected three times per year, roughly spring, summer, and fall. Benthic samples are collected by scrubbing substrata found in the dominant or subdominant habitat types and adding a known volume of rinsewater. Seston collection in wadeable streams is a simple grab in a 1L container. Phytoplankton are collected in lakes and rivers using a Kemmerer or Van Dorn sampler. Samples are subsampled, preserved, and sent to an external facility for identification.

|Site type|Benthic samples|Water column|
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
|Stream|3 in subdominant habitat|1 near sensor set 2 for chlorophyll/AFDM only|
|Lake|5 in littoral zone|3 near buoy, inlet, and outlet sensors|
|River|5 in littoral zone|1 near buoy, 2 in river channel|
