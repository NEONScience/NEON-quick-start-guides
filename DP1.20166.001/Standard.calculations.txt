Step 1: Convert to algal cells per L and correct for preservative volume when algalParameterUnit = countPerBottle (cells/L)
Step 2: Correct for benthicArea using calculation from Step 1 (cells/m2)

NEON suggests using algalParameter = 'cell density' for the calculations
 above. See DPUG for detailed descriptions of algalParameters.

samplingImpractical records in the fieldData table indicate instances
where samples could not be collected due to environmental conditions.
