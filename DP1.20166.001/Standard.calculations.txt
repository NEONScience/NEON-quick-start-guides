The periphyton and phytoplankton taxonomic counts come from an external lab in the field algalParameterValue. This field should be coupled with algalParameterUnit.

The taxonomic count data with algalParameterUnit = cellsPerBottle are not corrected for preservative volume or benthic area. Data users will need to refer to the benthicArea presented in the alg_fieldData table and apply this correction to get the number of algal cells per stream, lake, or river bottom. All taxon records from a sample should be summed and divided by the benthicArea prior to reporting the total abundance per m2.

NEON suggests using algalParameter = 'cell density' for the calculations above. See Data Product User Guide for specific equations and detailed descriptions of algalParameters .
