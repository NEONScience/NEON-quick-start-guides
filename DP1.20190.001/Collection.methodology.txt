Reaeration measurement is conducted at wadeable stream sites by the addition of a salt tracer or a salt-tracer and simultaneous inert gas-tracer at a known injection location and time. When simultaneous salt- and gas- tracer injections are performed, four sampling stations downstream of the injection location are sampled before the experiment to establish background data, and during the experiment to collect tracer samples. Submersible data loggers are deployed in the stream during all reaeration experiments at the most upstream and downstream sampling stations to collect conductivity, temperature, and specific conductance during the experiment. Collected samples are sent to an external laboratory for analysis. Reaeration measurements are completed 6 times per year at each site according to historical flow regime.
