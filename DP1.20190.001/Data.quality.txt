In the rea_fieldData table the quality flag incompleteExperimentQF is used to indicate that the reaeration experiment was incomplete in some way. In the rea_backgroundFieldSaltData_in and rea_plateauSampleFieldData_in tables the incompleteExperimentQF quality flag is used to indicate that external lab data will not be returned for one or more samples in the specific record. The expanded data package for this data product includes external lab metadata files (rea_externalLabDataGas and rea_externalLabDataSalt) with quality flags for gas and tracer sample analysis, and a summary file (sdg_externalLabSummaryData) of the external facility's method detection limits, precision, and uncertainty for each analyte.

Please note that quality checks are comprehensive but not exhaustive; therefore, unknown data quality issues may exist. Users are advised to evaluate quality of the data as relevant to the scientific research question being addressed, perform data review and post-processing prior to analysis, and use the data quality information and issue logs included in download packages to aid interpretation.
