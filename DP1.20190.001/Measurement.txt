Field and external laboratory data from reaeration experiments using a salt-tracer, or a simultaneous salt-tracer and inert gas-tracer. Measurements reported include stream conductivity and temperature (0.1 Hz), concentrations of salt- and gas-tracers in samples (mg/L; ppm), experiment start and end times, and thirty wetted widths (m).
