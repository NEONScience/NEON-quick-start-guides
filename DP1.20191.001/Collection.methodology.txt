Riparian vegetation percent cover is measured once annually during sampling windows designed to capture peak-greenness (at least 90% NDVI greenness) at wadeable stream and river sites. Measurements are taken using a convex spherical densiometer to count points of riparian cover and calculate vegetation percent cover at each of ten equally spaced riparian sampling transects throughout the 1 km reach at wadeable stream sites, and 0.3 meters out from the shore at the 5 plots nearest the thalweg at river sites. At wadealbe stream sites, at each transect six densiometer measurements are taken: four measurements from the center of the stream facing upstream, downstream, left, and right; and two measurements standing 0.3 m from the left and right banks facing out from the stream.  At river sites four densiometers are taken 0.3 meters in river from the bank at the five plots nearest the rivers thalweg: facing upstream, downstream, facing the left bank, and facing the right bank
