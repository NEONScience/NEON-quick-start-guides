In the sbd_fieldData table the quality flag incompleteExperimentQF is used to indicate that the reaeration experiment during which the salt-tracer information was obtained was incomplete in some way. In the sbd_backgroundFieldSaltData_in and sbd_plateauSampleFieldData_in tables the incompleteExperimentQF quality flag is used to indicate that external lab data will not be returned for one or more samples in the specific record.

Please note that quality checks are comprehensive but not exhaustive; therefore, unknown data quality issues may exist. Users are advised to evaluate quality of the data as relevant to the scientific research question being addressed, perform data review and post-processing prior to analysis, and use the data quality information and issue logs included in download packages to aid interpretation.
