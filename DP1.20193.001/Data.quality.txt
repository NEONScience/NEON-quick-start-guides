In the sbd_fieldData table the quality flag incompleteExperimentQF is used to indicate that the reaeration experiment during which the salt-tracer information was obtained was incomplete in some way. In the sbd_backgroundFieldSaltData_in and sbd_plateauSampleFieldData_in tables the incompleteExperimentQF quality flag is used to indicate that external lab data will not be returned for one or more samples in the specific record.
