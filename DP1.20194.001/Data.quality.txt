All analytical labs generating sediment chemical and physical data include standards run as unknowns alongside NEON samples. The data table asc_externalLabSummary, which is available in the sediment chemical and physical properties data product expanded packages, contains the long-term precision and accuracy of lab analyses.
The external lab also reports quality flags in the following fields: 'externalQualifier', 'extendedQualifier1', 'extendedQualifier2', 'extendedQualifier3', 'extendedQualifier4' and 'extendedQualifier5' in asc_externalLabData. These quality flags are described in section 4.5 of the NEON User Guide to Aquatic Sediment Chemical and Physical Properties. 

Please note that quality checks are comprehensive but not exhaustive; therefore, unknown data quality issues may exist. Users are advised to evaluate quality of the data as relevant to the scientific research question being addressed, perform data review and post-processing prior to analysis, and use the data quality information and issue logs included in download packages to aid interpretation.
