All analytical labs generating sediment chemical and physical data include standards alongside NEON samples. The data table asc_externalLabSummary, which is available in the sediment chemical and physical properties data product expanded packages, contains the long-term precision and accuracy of lab analyses.
The external lab also reports quality flags in the following fields: 'externalQualifier', 'extendedQualifier1', 'extendedQualifier2', 'extendedQualifier3', 'extendedQualifier4' and 'extendedQualifier5' in asc_externalLabData. These quality flags are defined in section 4.5 of the NEON User Guide to Aquatic Sediment Chemical and Physical Properties.
