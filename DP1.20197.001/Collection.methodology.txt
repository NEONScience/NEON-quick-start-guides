Aquatic sediment samples are collected in wadeable streams, rivers, and lakes twice annually, before and after peak productivity. Sediment samples are collected from 2 stations at each site: at wadeable streams and non-wadeable (large river) sites are divided in half longitudinally and sediment is collected throughout each half. In lakes, the two stations are near the buoy (the deep center point in the basin), and near the littoral zone sensors closer to the lake inlet (if evident, 1-2 m deep). At each sediment station, samples from several depositional zones are aggregated, homogenized, homogenized and distributed into a container for analysis. Samples are sent to an external facility for sediment size analyses. Specific field collection methodology is dependent on type of waterbody and the predominant sediment size composition.
