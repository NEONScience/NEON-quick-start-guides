Wadeable stream collection occurs in the thalweg near the downstream sensor set while non-wadeable streams sample from a depth of 0.5m and are taken up to 26 times per year (Fig 1). Lakes are sampled at up to 3 locations with variable depths near the bouy (and inflow and outflow at Toolik Lake) sensors 12 times per year (Fig 1). A more detailed description can be found in the AOS Protocol and Procedure: Stable Isotope Sampling in Surface Waters and Groundwater (NEON.DOC.002905). Samples are filtered within 3 hours of collection and are kept cold then shipped to the external laboratory.
