Wadeable stream collection occurs in the thalweg near the downstream sensor set while non-wadeable streams are sampled from a depth of 0.5m. Both are sampled up to 26 times per year. Lakes are sampled at up to 3 locations with variable depths near the buoy (and inflow and outflow at Toolik Lake) sensors 12 times per year. A more detailed description can be found in the AOS Protocol and Procedure: Stable Isotope Sampling in Surface Waters and Groundwater (NEON.DOC.002905). Samples are filtered within 3 hours of collection, kept cold, and shipped overnight to the analytical laboratory.
