The asi_fieldData table notes any issues with the condition of the samples at the time of collection in the sample condition fields (field names ending in SampleCond). In the asi_POMExternalLabDataPerSample and asi_externalLabH2OIsotopes tables, the sampleCondition field notes any issues with the condition of the samples at the time of analysis. In the asi_externalLabH2OIsotopes table, the isotopeH2OExternalLabQF indicates samples flagged by the lab for a high standard deviation.  The asi_externalLabSummaryData table provides data about long-term performance of the analytical laboratory, including accuracy and results of standards run as unknowns.

Please note that quality checks are comprehensive but not exhaustive; therefore, unknown data quality issues may exist. Users are advised to evaluate quality of the data as relevant to the scientific research question being addressed, perform data review and post-processing prior to analysis, and use the data quality information and issue logs included in download packages to aid interpretation.
