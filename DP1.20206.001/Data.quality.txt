The asi_fieldData table notes any issues with the condition of the samples at the time of collection in the sample condition fields (field names ending in SampleCond). In the asi_POMExternalLabDataPerSample and asi_externalLabH2OIsotopes tables, the sampleCondition field notes any issues with the condition of the samples at the time of analysis. In the asi_externalLabH2OIsotopes table, the isotopeH2OExternalLabQF indicates samples flagged by the lab for a high standard deviation.
