Analytical replicates of the POM samples, indicated by the field 'replicate' in the asi_POMExternalLabDataPerSample table, should typically be averaged to determine a single value per sample per analyte, before proceeding with further analyses. The H2O isotope data, in the asi_externalLabH2OIsotopes table, include the standard deviation of replicate samples, rather than reporting replicates individually.

Note that the asi_POMExternalLabDataPerSample table is reported in long format, with one record for each combination of sample and analyte, whereas the asi_externalLabH2OIsotopes table is reported in wide format, with separate columns for each analyte.
