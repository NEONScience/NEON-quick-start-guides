Each measurement is accompanied by a final quality flag (gWatTempFinalQF). NEON recommends only using data where the corresponding final quality flag is 0. Data with a final quality flag of 1 are potentially inaccurate and should only be used with caution. The final quality flags are based on automated QA/QC tests, including range, step, and signal despiking tests, as well as a manually set science review flag if applicable. Each measurement is accompanied by an estimate of measurement uncertainty, expressed at the 95% confidence level (groundwaterTempExpUncert), which comprises known and quantifiable uncertainties.
