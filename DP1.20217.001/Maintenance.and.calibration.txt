Sensors are calibrated before deployment to the site, and are recalibrated on an annual basis. Sensors are only removed from their measurement location for quarterly maintenance and on an as-needed basis to ensure data quality. Groundwater clarity checks are conducted on a quarterly basis and wells are redeveloped when necessary.
