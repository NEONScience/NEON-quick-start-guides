Zooplankton are collected at lake sites three times annually (roughly spring, summer and fall). Samples are collected at the inlet, outlet and buoy (deepest) locations using a vertical tow net or a Schindler-Patalas sampler, depending on water depth. Typically, multiple samples (up to 3) are collected per sample location and composited into a single sample and total water volume is recorded. Composite samples are preserved with ethanol in the field and sent to an external facility for taxonomic identification.
