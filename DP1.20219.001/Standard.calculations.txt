Standard calculations for zooplankton data include converting count data, 'adjCountPerBottle' from the zoo_taxonomyProcessed table to a per-sample volume value. For quantitative results, taxon records from a sample should be summed by sample and divided by the 'towTrapsVolume' in the zoo_fieldData prior to reporting the total abundance per L.
