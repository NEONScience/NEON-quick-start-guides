Zooplankton are collected in lakes three times annually (roughly spring, summer and fall). Samples are collected at the inlet, outlet and buoy (deepest) locations using a vertical tow net or a Schindler-Patalas sampler, depending on water depth. Typically, multiple samples (up to 3) are collected per sample location and composited into a single sample and total water volume is recorded. Composite samples are preserved with ethanol in the field. Samples from the second sampling bout are sent to an analytical laboratory where sample homogenization, DNA extraction, sequencing library preparation, and DNA sequencing occur, while samples from bouts 1 and 3 are stored in the NEON biorepository and are not processed.
