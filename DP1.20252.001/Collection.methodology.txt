Secchi depth measurements taken in lakes and non-wadable streams during ice-free periods anytime phytoplankton, zooplankton, pelagic microbes, or pelagic surface water chemistry samples are being collected. Secchi depth is measured once at the beginning of the day at bouy location, from the bow of the boat with the engine off. Sediments are allowed to settle for five minutes after anchoring. Secchi disk lowered  slowly until white quadrants disappear from view (depth= Secchi1), lowered another half meter, then slowly raised until white quadrants appear in view (depth=Secchi2). The mean of the two depths is taken to be the final Secchi Depth.
