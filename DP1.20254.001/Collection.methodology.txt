Vertical profile of temperature, conductivity, and dissolved oxygen (DO) is measured once per day at the buoy location, anytime phytoplankton, zooplankton, pelagic microbes, or pelagic surface water chemistry samples are being collected. The measurement is taken from the bow of the boat with the engine off. A YSI probe is lowered through the entire water column, with temperature, DO, specific conductivity, and depth measured every 0.5m.
