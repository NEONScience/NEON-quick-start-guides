Sensor height (zOffset; m), the latitude, longitude (referenceLatitude, referenceLongitude; Â°), and elevation (m) of the infrastructure base are in the sensor positions file (...sensor_positions...csv). Use the HOR.VER component of the time series file name (horizontalPosition and verticalPosition if stacked using neonUtilities) to link to the corresponding row in the HOR.VER column of the sensor positions file. An HOR of 103 corresponds to buoys. HORs of 130 and 140 correspond to littoral zones of lakes.
