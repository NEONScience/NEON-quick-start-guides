Water level at the staff gauge is documented before and after all aquatic protocols. It is measured by reading the value of the staff gauge at the surface of the water. The staff gauge is demarcated by thick black lines on the right and numbers on the left that indicate meter marks. Each line represents a measurement point on the top and bottom where the numbers correspond to the bottom of lines with a slanted edge. Half way points between numbers are designated by the top of a smaller, slanted line.  The elevation of the staff gauge is related to the elevation of permanent benchmarks installed nearby in order to establish vertical control at the site.
