Gauge height is recorded at the beginning and end of the measurement period, to capture changes in water height during field activities. Various site conditions are also recorded; see variables file and User Guide for details.

Please note that quality checks are comprehensive but not exhaustive; therefore, unknown data quality issues may exist. Also note that, conversely, some quality-flagged data are still usable depending on the scientific use case. Additionally, these [Level 1 data](https://www.neonscience.org/data-samples/data-management/data-processing) are not currently gap-filled or corrected for sensor drift or shifts, such as those introduced by sensor swaps or field calibrations. Users are advised to evaluate quality of the data as relevant to the scientific research question being addressed, perform data review and post-processing prior to analysis, and use the data quality flags, issue logs, and maintenance records included in download packages to aid interpretation. A tutorial with examples of how to do this can be found [here](https://www.neonscience.org/resources/learning-hub/tutorials/clean-neon-ais-data).
