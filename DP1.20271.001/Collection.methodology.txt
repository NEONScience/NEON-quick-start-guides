Measurements are taken by sensors on buoys located in lakes and rivers. The sensor directly measures temperature via a platinum resistance thermometer and relative humidity via a thin film polymer capacitor. The sensor also calculates dew point/frost point from the temperature and relative humidity measurements. Temperature and relative humidity are measured every minute and reported as 1-minute instantaneous measurements and 30-minute mean values. Dew or frost point is calculated and available as 1-minute and 30-minute averages.
