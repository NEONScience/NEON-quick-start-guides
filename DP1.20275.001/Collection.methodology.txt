Riparian vegetation composition and structure is measured once annually during sampling windows designed to capture peak-greenness (at least 90% NDVI greenness) at lakes, rivers, and wadeable streams. Observations made include dominant riparian vegetation composition, physical bank and vegetation structure characteristics, and presence of human structures or revetments. Measurements are taken at ten riparian plots equally spaced throughout the 1 km reach at stream and river sites or around the perimeter of the lake at lake sites. Plots are 10 meters wide and 10 meters long at wadeable stream and 10 meters wide and 15 meters long at rivers and lakes, extending from the bank/shore out towards the riparian and adjacent terrestrial systems.
