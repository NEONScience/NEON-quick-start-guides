Most aquatic sites have up to eight shallow (<100 ft depth) groundwater observation wells on the perimeter of sampled waterbodies (Fig 1). Groundwater chemistry samples are collected from a subset of three to four wells at each site. Samples are typically collected via groundwater pump or bailer tube and specific methodology can vary based on site conditions. A detailed description of sample collection methodology can be found in the AOS Protocol and Procedure: Stable Isotope Sampling in Surface Waters and Groundwater (NEON.DOC.002905). Samples are filtered at the time of collection and are kept cold until shipped to the external laboratory for processing.
