Data on conditions during sampling can be found in the gwc_fieldSuperParent table, including water depth in the wells, sampling methodology, and volume of water purged. The gwc_wellStabilization table provides data about stabilization of water in the well associated with sampling. The gsi_fieldData table notes any issues with the condition of the sample at the time of collection, in the isotopeH2OSampleCond field. In the gsi_externalLabH2OIsotopes table, the sampleCondition field notes any issues with the condition of the sample at the time of analysis, and the isotopeH2OExternalLabQF indicates samples flagged by the lab for a high standard deviation. The asi_externalLabSummaryData table provides data about long-term performance of the analytical laboratory, including accuracy and results of standards run as unknowns.
