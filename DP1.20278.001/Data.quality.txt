As much as possible, surface water microbe group abundance data follows the Minimum Information of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments (MIQE) metadata and data quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) guidelines. Data are automatically passed through initial input constraints and data validation checks when they are ingested into the NEON database. Data generated before 2017 were not processed with the full range of data quality control checks. Details of the real-time PCR workflow used by the external lab to generate these group abundance data can be found in the expanded version of this data package.
