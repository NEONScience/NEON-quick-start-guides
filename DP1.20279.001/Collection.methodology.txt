Samples are collected in wadeable streams at up to 8 locations within a 1 km stream reach in the two dominant benthic habitats. Sampling occurs annually during peak greenness in conjunction with periphyton sampling. Samples are collected using aseptic methods to minimize contamination. Depending on the sample substratum, collection may include filtering water, collecting sediment, or collecting plant material for analysis. Samples are frozen in the field on dry ice and transported and stored frozen.
