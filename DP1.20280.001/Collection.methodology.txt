Samples are collected in wadeable streams at up to 8 locations within a 1 km stream reach in the two dominant benthic habitats. Samples are collected 3 times per year roughly in spring, summer and autumn. Depending on the sample substratum, collection may include filtering water, collecting sediment, or collecting plant material for analysis. For all sample types, collection is performed using aseptic methods and samples are frozen in the field on dry ice. Samples are transported and stored frozen.
