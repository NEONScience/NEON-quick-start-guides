All tables in this data product can be joined by the dnaSampleID. When joining the mmg_benthicMarkerGeneSequencing_16S and _ITS tables and the mmg_benthicRawDataFiles tables, use the dnaSampleID x targetGene to distinguish 16S and ITS records. The marker genes tables can be joined among other benthic data streams by linking the geneticSampleID in table mmg_benthicDnaExtraction to the geneticSampleID in table amb_fieldParent of this data product, and then finding the associated sampleID to link to other analyses. Benthic microbe community composition and Benthic microbe group abundance data can be linked with this product using the dnaSampleID x targetGene fields.
