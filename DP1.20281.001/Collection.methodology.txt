Samples are collected annually during the period of peak productivity. Between 1-3 samples are collected based on the habitat type and level of stratification of the water body. Water is filtered using aseptic methods and filters are frozen in the field on dry ice. Samples are transported and stored frozen. Samples are shipped on dry ice to an external facility for analysis.
