Numerous laboratory QAQC checks are implemented at the DNA extraction and sequence processing stages. Samples that do not meet these QAQC criteria will be noted as "Fail" in the qaqcStatus fields in the respective data tables, or may include additional quality flags. Samples must achieve a minimum number of sequences of sufficient quality in order to pass QAQC. These criteria are subject to change over time as technology and standards evolve.
