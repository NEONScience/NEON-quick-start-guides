Sequence data are generated in batches of multiple samples, which are parsed into separate files on a per-sample basis. For bidirectional sequencing runs, 2 sequence files are created per sample, one for each sequencing read direction.

Samples must achieve a minimum number of sequences of sufficient quality in order to pass QAQC. Samples must also pass QAQC checks during the various processing steps. Samples that do not meet these QAQC criteria will be noted as "Fail" in the qaqcStatus fields in the respective data tables, or may include additional quality flags.
