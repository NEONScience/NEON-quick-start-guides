Samples are collected monthly in wadeable streams and every other month in lakes and large rivers. For lakes, samples are collected at the buoy sensor station and at the inlet/outlet locations, for lakes with true inlets and outlets. Large rivers are sampled at the buoy sensor station, and wadeable streams are sampled at the downstream sensor array. Water is filtered using aseptic methods and filters are frozen in the field on dry ice. Samples are transported and stored frozen.
