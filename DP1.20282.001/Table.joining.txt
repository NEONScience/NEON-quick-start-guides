All tables in this data product can be joined by the dnaSampleID. When joining the mmg_swMarkerGeneSequencing_16S and _ITS tables and the mmg_swRawDataFiles tables, use the dnaSampleID x targetGene to distinguish 16S and ITS records. The marker genes tables can be joined among other surface water data streams by linking the geneticSampleID in table mmg_swDnaExtraction to the geneticSampleID in table amc_fieldGenetic of this data product, and from there finding the associated sampleID to link to other analyses. Surface water microbe community composition and surface water microbe group abundance data can be linked with this product using the dnaSampleID x targetGene fields.
