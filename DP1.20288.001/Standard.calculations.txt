High frequency (1-min) data collected at wadeable stream sites can be averaged to reduce sensor noise and match the temporal resolution of other NEON data products. 
Sensor height (zOffset; m), the latitude, longitude (referenceLatitude, referenceLongitude; Â°), and elevation (m) of the in stream infrastructure base are in the sensor positions file (...sensor_positions...csv). Use the HOR.VER component of the time series file name (horizontalPosition and verticalPosition if stacked using neonUtilities) to link to the corresponding row in the HOR.VER column of the sensor positions file. An HOR of 101 or 111 correspond to Sensor Set 1 (upstream) and HOR of 102 or 112 correspond to Sensor Set 2 (downstream).  An HOR of 103 correspond to buoys.
