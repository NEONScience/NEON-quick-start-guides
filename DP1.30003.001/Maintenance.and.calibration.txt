The NEON AOP LiDAR is calibrated every winter between flight seasons. Calibration/validation flights for horizontal, vertical, and timing accuracy are conducted at the beginning and end of every flight season. Nominal runway flights are conducted in each domain flown during the flight season to ensure there is no accuracy drift. Field validation exercises collecting GPS points are typically conducted once per flight season.
