Each NIS flight line is processed from raw L0 DN to L1 radiance using the lab and onboard calibration information. Each radiance flight line is then orthorectified using a digital surface model from the co-collected lidar data. The orthorectified radiance flight lines are then processed to directional surface reflectance using the atmospheric correction and modeling package ATCOR and distributed including all 420+ bands in HDF5 format for each individual flight line.
