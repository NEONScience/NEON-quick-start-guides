Downloaded data include a quality report for each flight flown over a site, as well as the site as a whole, describing cloud conditions, positioning errors, parameters used for atmospheric corrections, instrument health, and other data quality considerations made during flight collection and processing of data. Flightlines are each assigned color-coded quality flags indicating cloud cover (green <10%, yellow 10%-50%, red >50%). Pixels missing data are coded -9999.

Please note that quality checks are comprehensive but not exhaustive; therefore, unknown data quality issues may exist. Users are advised to evaluate quality of the data as relevant to the scientific research question being addressed, perform data review and post-processing prior to analysis, and use the data quality information and issue logs included in download packages to aid interpretation.
