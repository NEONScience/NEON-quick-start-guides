Each NIS flight line is processed from raw L0 DN to L1 radiance using the lab and onboard calibration information. Each radiance flight line is then orthorectified using a digital surface model from the co-collected lidar data and distributed in HDF5 format for each individual flight line including all 420+ bands.
