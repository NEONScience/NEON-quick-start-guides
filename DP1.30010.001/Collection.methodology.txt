NEON AOP instruments, including the medium format digital camera, are flown at 1000 m above ground level at 100 knots in flight lines that have 60% along-track overlap and 37% cross-track overlap. This results in a minimum of eight-centimeter ground pixel resolution. NEON sites are flown once per year with a target of 90% of maximum greenness or higher and at a minimum of 3 of every 4 years. Flight coverage is a minimum of 10 km by 10 km and covers both NEON tower and observational sampling sites. Aquatic sites, as well as those in Hawaii and Puerto Rico, are flown in the same fashion, but at reduced frequency.
