Raw camera images are first color corrected for white balance and then adjusted for proper exposure, and then orthorectified. Orthorectification is the process of remapping the pixels in an image from the captured projection to a regular geographic projection while removing distortions introduced by land surface topography, imperfections in the camera lens, and tilt of the camera caused by aircraft attitude variations.  The orthorectification process consists of defining a uniform grid on the ground covering the full extent of the image through a series of data-frame transformations. Then each ground pixel is ray-traced back up to the camera image, filling in each orthorectified pixel with the nearest-neighbor image pixel. Ray-tracing is performed using the camera model determined from the boresight calibrations flights and a lidar derived digital terrain model (DTM). The pixel resolution at the ground is set at 10 cm.
