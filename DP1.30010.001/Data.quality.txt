Downloaded data include a data quality report for each site.This report includes a description of conditions for each flight (number of images, cloud conditions, anomalies), the processing parameters and a histogram of the tie point errors created from the orthorectified images. This plot is a good measure of the orthorectification error. The NEON data quality requirement for the mean orthorectification error is 0.5 meters or less.

Please note that quality checks are comprehensive but not exhaustive; therefore, unknown data quality issues may exist. Users are advised to evaluate quality of the data as relevant to the scientific research question being addressed, perform data review and post-processing prior to analysis, and use the data quality information and issue logs included in download packages to aid interpretation.
