Field spectral reflectance and transmittance are opportunistic data products collected in conjunction with NEON AOP overflights, most often in coordination with TOS Canopy Foliage Sampling. Samples are collected from both tower and observational plots across the NEON site. A spectroradiometer is used to take either field or lab measurements of the raw spectral reflectance of samples. Spectral reflectance of both the front and back of the sample is measured against a nearly 100% reflective white spectralon reference panel. A black spectralon reference is then measured, followed by spectral transmittance measurements of the front and back of the sample. Reference measurements of the white reference are taken between each leaf measurement.
