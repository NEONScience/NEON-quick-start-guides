Raw spectroradiometer measurements are a combination of both the sample and the light source. A white reference panel is measured between each set of sample measurements in order to determine the contribution of the light source. A black panel is also measured and used as the backdrop for sample transmittance measurements. Calibrated spectral reflectance values are calculated from the raw digital number obtained from the ASD instrument; contact NEON for algorithm details.
