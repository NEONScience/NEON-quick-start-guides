Metadata describing the condition and position of the leaf and and plant before sampling can be found in the fsp_sampleMetadata table. The instrument, light source, and foreoptic details for each sampling bout can be found in the fsp_boutMetadata table. To find the geographic location of each plant, use the plant crown shapefiles in the Plant foliar physical and chemical properties data product (DP1.10026.001, table cfc_shapefile). For the locations of plants that have not been mapped to shapefiles, follow the instructions in the Data Product User Guide for DP1.10026.001.

Please note that quality checks are comprehensive but not exhaustive; therefore, unknown data quality issues may exist. Users are advised to evaluate quality of the data as relevant to the scientific research question being addressed, perform data review and post-processing prior to analysis, and use the data quality information and issue logs included in download packages to aid interpretation.
