Metadata describing the condition and position of the leaf and and plant before sampling can be found in the fsp_sampleMetadata table. The instrument, light source, and foreoptic details for each sampling bout can be found in the fsp_boutMetadata table. To find the geographic location of each plant, use the plant crown shapefiles in the Plant foliar physical and chemical properties data product (DP1.10026.001, table cfc_shapefile). For the locations of plants that have not been mapped to shapefiles, follow the instructions in the Data Product User Guide for DP1.10026.001.
