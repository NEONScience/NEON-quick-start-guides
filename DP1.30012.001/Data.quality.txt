Quality control constraints are implemented during data entry and ingestion, for example by restricting the allowable formats or values for each field. A mobile application or web user interface is used for data entry, which standardizes records and flags or disallows non-conforming entries. Each data record includes a “dataQF” field, which is a quality flag describing any known issues with the record. For example, data collected prior to 2019 were recorded on paper datasheets and are accompanied by the “legacyData” quality flag.
