Time rate of change of CO2 concentration is calculated from L1 CO2 concentration data linearly interpolated to 1-minute resolution. The time average of the four-minutes of measurement at the end of a half hour period minus the time average of the four-minutes of measurement at the beginning of the same half hour provides a temporally interpolated storage flux estimate at each measurement level with a resolution of 30 minutes.
