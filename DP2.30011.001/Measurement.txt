The ratio of solar energy reflected off of the earthâ€™s surface to total incident energy in the 0.4 to 2.5 micron wavelength range and modeled to best account for the many influencing factors such as reflectance angle/wavelength, solar angle, and scattering, absorbing, & re-radiating effects of atmospheric conditions. Albedo data values range from 0 to 1.
