Downloaded data include a quality report for each flight flown over a site, as well as the site as a whole, describing cloud conditions, positioning errors, parameters used for atmospheric corrections, and other data quality considerations made during flight collection and processing of data. Each fPAR flight line is accompanied by an associated fPAR uncertainty GeoTIFF showing potential error. Flightlines are each assigned color-coded quality flags indicating cloud cover (green <10%, yellow 10%-50%, red >50%). Pixels missing data are coded -9999.
