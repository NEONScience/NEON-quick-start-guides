NEON AOP instruments, including the NEON Imaging Spectrometer (NIS), are flown at 1000 m above ground level at 100 knots in flight lines that have 37% overlap. This results in NIS collections at 1 m spatial resolution and 5 nm spectral resolution in over 420 bands with wavelengths spanning from 380 to 2500 nm. All AOP L1 data products are distributed in individual flight lines (typically 600m wide by 5 to 20 km long). NEON sites are flown once per year with a target of 90% of maximum greenness or higher and at a minimum of 3 of every 4 years. Flight coverage is a minimum of 10 km by 10 km and covers both NEON tower and observational sampling sites. Aquatic sites, as well as those in Hawaii and Puerto Rico, are flown in the same fashion, but at reduced frequency.
