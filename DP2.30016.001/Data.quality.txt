Downloaded data include a quality report for each flight flown over a site, as well as the site as a whole, describing cloud conditions, positioning errors, parameters used for atmospheric corrections, instrument health, and other data quality considerations made during flight collection and processing of data. Flightlines are each assigned color-coded  quality flags indicating cloud cover (green <10%, yellow 10%-50%, red >50%). Pixels of missing data are coded -9999.
