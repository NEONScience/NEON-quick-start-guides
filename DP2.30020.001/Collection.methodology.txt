NEON AOP instruments, including the NEON Imaging Spectrometer (NIS), are flown at 1000 m above ground level at 100 knots in flight lines that have 37% overlap. This results in reflectance spectra data for each pixel in over 420 discrete 5-nm bandpasses between 380 and 2500 nm with a spatial resolution corrected to 1 m. Canopy xanthophyll Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) estimates the relative amount of xanthophyll pigments in vegetation and land cover using spectral bands at 531 nm and 570 nm for each individual north-south flightline in this data package. NEON sites are flown once per year with a target of 90% of maximum greenness or higher and at a minimum of 3 of every 4 years. Flight coverage is a minimum of 10 km by 10 km and covers both NEON tower and observational sampling sites. Aquatic sites, as well as the terrestrial sites in Hawaii and Puerto Rico, are flown in the same fashion, but at reduced frequency.
