Downloaded data include a quality report for each flight flown over a site, as well as the site as a whole, describing cloud conditions, positioning errors, parameters used for atmospheric corrections, and other data quality considerations and QA metrics made during collection and processing. Flightlines are each assigned color-coded quality flags indicating cloud cover (green <10%, yellow 10%-50%, red >50%). An uncertainty raster is included for each spectral index.
