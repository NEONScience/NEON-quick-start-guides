Each NIS flight line is processed from raw L0 DN to L1 radiance using the lab and onboard calibration information. Each radiance flight line is then orthorectified using a digital surface model from the co-collected lidar data. The orthorectified radiance flight lines are then processed to directional surface reflectance using the atmospheric correction and modeling package ATCOR and distributed including all 426 bands in HDF5 format for each individual flight line. The flightline HDF5 files at a given site are then merged and distributed in 1 km by 1 km L3 tiles where pixels are selected from flightlines with the highest quality cloud conditions at collect and closest proximity to nadir.
