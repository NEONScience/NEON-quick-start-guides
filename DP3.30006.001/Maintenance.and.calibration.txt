Calibration activities are conducted on the NIS every winter between flight seasons in the NEON AOP lab where it measures known radiance sources in a controlled environment. Calibration/validation flights are flown at the beginning and end of every flight season for positional and timing accuracy as well as measuring radiance and reflectance over well-characterized, homogenous targets. In each domain collected, an in-situ calibration is conducted where the NIS records radiance from a known portable mercury lamp positioned directly under the sensor. Finally, at the start and end of each flight line flown, a set of on-board calibrations are made. These calibration activities allow any variances in the spectral response of the focal plane to be characterized, recorded, and tracked.
