The solar energy reflected off of the earthâ€™s surface in the 0.4 to 2.5 micron wavelength range and modeled using ATCOR to best account for the many influencing factors such as reflectance angle/wavelength, solar angle, and scattering, absorbing, & re-radiating effects of atmospheric conditions. Surface reflectance data values range from 0 to 1 and are scaled by 10,000 and orthorectified to a UTM projection with 1 m pixels.
