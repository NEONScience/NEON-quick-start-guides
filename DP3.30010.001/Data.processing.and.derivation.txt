A mosaic is a collection of orthorectified images that are stitched and blended together to create one seamless image of an entire survey area. NEON has developed an algorithm to perform the following steps. First, orthorectified images are selected for mosaicking based on location and orientation, typically from only North-South survey lines. Next, the zenith angle, or the angle between the orthogonal direction of the pixel plane and nadir, is found for each pixel and stored in a zenith file. The aggregate of these files determines the coverage area of the mosaic and 1km x 1km tiles are created within this area. Then, all of the overlapping images within a tile are found. Within these images, the pixels that are facing the most upwards, or have the smallest zenith angle, are selected to populate the tile. This process reduces distortion effects caused by the difference in resolution between the digital terrain model and the images, which can cause unnatural features to display such as swirls and outward bending. Placing the tiles next to each other creates the mosaic for the entire area surveyed. Because of the nature of the surveys, images for an entire site may be collected over many days with different lighting conditions. This can cause contrast differences that can sometimes be seen in the mosaic, with darker appearing areas next to lighter appearing areas of the same objects.
