To account for camera specific variables and the orientation of the camera on the plane, a boresight calibration flight is performed twice per year: pre and post season. This process involves correlating ground truth points and tie points within images collected during the boresight flight. These data are used to create a complete camera model consisting of camera, distortion, and alignment models used in the orthorectification process. The camera model accounts for the geometry of components within the camera and for the distortion caused by the camera optics. The alignment model is created to determine the relative position of the camera’s sensor in relation to the measurement point for the aircraft’s positioning and orientation system. The post-season calibration flight is used to ensure that the camera alignment has not changed.
