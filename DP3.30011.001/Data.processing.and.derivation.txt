Each NIS flight line is processed from raw L0 DN to L1 radiance using the lab calibration information. Each radiance flight line is then orthorectified using a digital surface models from the co-collected lidar data. The orthorectified radiance flight lines are then processed to directional surface reflectance using the atmospheric correction and modeling package ATCOR. ATCOR is also used to integrate the reflectance values across the albedo wavelength range and ratio against the modeled incident radiance for the flightline acquisition time and location, producing the final albedo values written out to GeoTiff files for individual flight lines. The flightline GeoTiff files at a given site are then merged and distributed in 1 km by 1 km tiles where pixels are selected from flightlines with the highest quality cloud conditions at collect and closest proximity to nadir.
