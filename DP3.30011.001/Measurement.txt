The ratio of solar energy reflected off of the earthâ€™s surface to total incident energy in the 0.4 to 2.5 micron wavelength range and modeled to best account for the many influencing factors such as reflectance angle/wavelength, solar angle, and scattering, absorbing, & re-radiating effects of atmospheric conditions. Albedo data values range from 0 to 1. All AOP L3 data are distributed in 1 km by 1 km tiles which include the Easting and Northing coordinates (in that order) of their southwest corner in their file names.
