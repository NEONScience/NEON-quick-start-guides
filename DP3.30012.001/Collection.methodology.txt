NEON AOP instruments, including the NEON Imaging Spectrometer (NIS), are flown at 1000 m above ground level at 100 knots in flight lines that have 37% overlap. This results in reflectance spectra data for each pixel in over 420 discrete 5-nm bandpasses between 380 and 2500 nm with a spatial resolution corrected to 1 m. Leaf Area Index (LAI) estimates the leaf area per ground area using spectral bands at 650 nm and 850 nm. This package contains mosaicked groupings of individual flightlines to provide LAI for areas of 1 km x 1 km with spatial resolution corrected to 1 meter pixels whose values reflect that of the most-nadir pixel from the original flightline. NEON sites are flown once per year with a target of 90% of maximum greenness or higher and at a minimum of 3 of every 4 years. Flight coverage is a minimum of 10 km by 10 km and covers both NEON tower and observational sampling sites. Aquatic sites, as well as the terrestrial sites in Hawaii and Puerto Rico, are flown in the same fashion, but at reduced frequency.
