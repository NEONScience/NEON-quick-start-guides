Each NIS flight line is processed from raw L0 DN to L1 radiance using the lab and onboard calibration information. Each radiance flight line is then orthorectified using a digital surface models from the co-collected lidar data. The orthorectified radiance flight lines are then processed to directional surface reflectance using the atmospheric correction and modeling package ATCOR. fPAR is then derived from the directional surface reflectance through the calculated L2 Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) and Leaf Area Index (LAI), producing the final unit-less values (and their associated uncertainty) written out to GeoTiff files for individual flight lines. The flightline GeoTIFF files at a given site are then merged and distributed in L3 1 km by 1 km tiles where pixels are selected from flightlines with the highest quality cloud conditions at collect and closest proximity to nadir.
