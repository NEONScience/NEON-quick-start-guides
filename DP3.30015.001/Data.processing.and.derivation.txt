Raw discrete LiDAR data are processed to projected and corrected L1 LAZ point clouds in their original flight lines. First (highest elevation) LiDAR returns are gridded to 1 m pixels to create a digital surface model (DSM). Last (lowest elevation) returns are gridded to 1 m pixels to create a bare earth digital elevation model (DEM). Triangulation and interpolation are used to fill any gaps in DEM data if the LiDAR was unable to reach the ground. A raw canopy height model is created by subtracting the DEM from the DSM and preserving the values greater than 2 m in height (minimum detectable tree height). The finished CHM is created by filling any missed canopy-top pixels (“pits”).
