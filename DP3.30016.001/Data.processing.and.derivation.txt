Each NIS flight line is processed from raw L0 DN to L1 radiance using the lab and onboard calibration information. Each radiance flight line is then orthorectified using a digital surface model from the co-collected lidar data. The orthorectified radiance flight lines are then processed to directional surface reflectance using the atmospheric correction and modeling package ATCOR. From here NDVI is calculated from the directional surface radiance, from which Total Biomass is then derived using a biomass-NDVI equation reported by Dong et al. 2003. In this data package individual flightlines are mosaicked together to create 1 km x 1 km raster tiles.
