Calibration activities are conducted on the NEON Imaging Spectrometer (NIS) every winter between flight seasons in the NEON AOP lab where the NIS is used to measure known radiance sources in a controlled environment. Calibration/validation flights are flown at the beginning and end of every flight season for positional and timing accuracy as well as to measure spectra over known spectral targets (tarps) and well-characterized, homogenous ground sites. At each new domain, an in-situ calibration is conducted where the NIS records radiance from a known portable mercury lamp positioned directly under the sensor. Finally, at the start and end of each flight line flown, an on-board calibration occurs before and after data collect. All of the calibration activities allow any variances in the spectral response of the focal plane to be characterized, recorded, and tracked.
