Foliar samples are collected once every five years at each terrestrial site to measure various biophysical and biochemical leaf traits, including carbon and nitrogen content, leaf mass per area, leaf water content, chlorophyll concentration, stable isotopes, and major and minor elements. Accurate modeling requires precise spatial alignment of field and airborne data. From 2020 onward, crowns of sampled vegetation individuals were digitized in the field using previously collected AOP imagery, generating shapefiles that allow precise georeferencing. Where digitized tree crowns were unavailable, field-measured tree crown widths were used to approximate crown extents. Airborne campaigns that included imaging spectroscopy were conducted in close coordination with the foliar sampling efforts to maximize temporal overlap. Flight coverage is a minimum of 10 km x 10 km at 1 m spatial resolution and covers both NEON tower and observational sampling sites.
