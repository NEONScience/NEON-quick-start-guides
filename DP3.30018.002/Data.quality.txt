Canopy nitrogen (%) maps are provided as 1 x 1 km geotiff (.tif) files and include the following additional layers:

a) Canopy nitrogen model uncertainty showing the uncertainty associated with the %N predictions from each decision tree in the final random forest model for each 1 m pixel within the tile.

b) Classification result for needle vs non-needle model, which is a binary map generated using SVM classification, where needle types are coded as 0 and non-needle types as 1 for each 1 m pixel within the tile.

c) NDVI mask to exclude non-vegetated areas, such as roads, water bodies, built-up areas, and bare rock.

Pixels with missing data are coded -9999.
