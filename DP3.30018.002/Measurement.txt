Site-level maps of canopy nitrogen content (%N) generated by linking foliar chemistry measurements from georeferenced samples (DP1.10026.001) with NEON’s spectrometer orthorectified surface directional reflectance data product (DP1.30006.001). Maps for %N and ancillary information are provided as 1 x 1 km tiles in geotiff (.tif) format at 1 m spatial resolution. Individual tile files included 1) canopy nitrogen percent, 2) canopy nitrogen model uncertainty, 3) classification result for needle vs. non-needle model, and 4) valid pixel mask based on NDVI threshold.
