NEON AOP instruments, including the NEON Imaging Spectrometer (NIS), are flown at 1000 m above ground level at 100 knots in flight lines that have 37% overlap. This results in reflectance spectra data for each pixel in over 420 discrete 5-nm bandpasses between 380 and 2500 nm with a spatial resolution corrected to 1 m. Canopy xanthophyll Photochecmical Reflectance index (PRI) estimates the relative amount of xanthophyll pigments in vegetation and land cover using spectral bands at 531 nm and 570 nm. This package contains mosaicked groupings of individual flightlines to provide relative canopy xanthophyll content according to PRI for areas of 1 km x 1 km with spatial resolution corrected to 1 meter pixels whose values reflect that of the most-nadir pixel from the original flightline. NEON sites are flown once per year with a target of 90% of maximum greenness or higher and at a minimum of 3 of every 4 years. Flight coverage is a minimum of 10 km by 10 km and covers both NEON tower and observational sampling sites. Aquatic sites, as well as those in Hawaii and Puerto Rico, are flown in the same fashion, but at reduced frequency.
