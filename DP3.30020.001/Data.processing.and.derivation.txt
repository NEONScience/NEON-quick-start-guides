Each NIS flight line is processed from raw L0 DN to L1 radiance using the lab and onboard calibration information. Each radiance flight line is then orthorectified using a digital surface model from the co-collected lidar data. The orthorectified radiance flight lines are then processed to directional surface reflectance using the atmospheric correction and modeling package ATCOR. The Canopy xanthophyll cycle Photochemical Reflectance Index can then be calculated from the directional surface reflectance using the spectral band values that are characteristic to the index, producing the final unit-less value (and associated uncertainty) written out to GeoTiff files. In this data package individual flightlines are mosaicked together to create 1 km x 1 km raster tiles for each index.
