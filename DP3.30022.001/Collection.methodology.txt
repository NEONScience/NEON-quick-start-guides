NEON AOP instruments, including the NEON Imaging Spectrometer (NIS), are flown at 1000 m above ground level at 100 knots in flight lines that have 37% overlap. This results in NIS collections at 1 m spatial resolution and 5 nm spectral resolution in over 420 bands from 380 to 2500 nm. Total canopy lignin content is estimated using spectral features of leaf lignin concentration and canopy foliage biomass combined in the 1754 nm range to calculate a normalized difference lignin index (NDLI). This package contains mosaicked individual flightlines to provide indices for areas of 1 km x 1 km with 1 m pixels whose values reflect that of the most-nadir pixel from the most cloud-free original flightline. NEON sites are flown once per year with a target of 90% of maximum greenness or higher and at a minimum of 3 of every 4 years. Flight coverage is a minimum of 10 km by 10 km and covers both NEON tower and observational sampling sites. Aquatic sites, as well as the terrestrial sites in Hawaii and Puerto Rico, are flown in the same fashion, but at reduced frequency.
