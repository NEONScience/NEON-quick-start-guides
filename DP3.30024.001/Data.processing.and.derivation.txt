Raw discrete LiDAR data are processed to projected and corrected L1 LAZ point clouds in their original flight lines. First (highest elevation) LiDAR returns are gridded to 1 m pixels to create a digital surface model (DSM). Last (lowest elevation) returns are gridded to 1 m pixels to create a bare earth digital elevation model (DEM). Triangulation and interpolation are used to fill any gaps in DEM data if the LiDAR was unable to reach the ground.
