A quality report for each flight used in producing the data product, describing weather conditions and other data quality considerations during flight, is available for download via the L1 AOP LiDAR products. The L1 AOP LiDAR products also include uncertainty point clouds in LAZ format and processing quality report PDFs.

Please note that quality checks are comprehensive but not exhaustive; therefore, unknown data quality issues may exist. Users are advised to evaluate quality of the data as relevant to the scientific research question being addressed, perform data review and post-processing prior to analysis, and use the data quality information and issue logs included in download packages to aid interpretation.
