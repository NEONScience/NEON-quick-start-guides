Elevation values are recorded for both the Digital Terrain Model (DTM) and Digital Surface Model (DSM), where DTM records only bare earth terrain and DSM records elevations related to the surface features (e.g. buildings and vegetation). Both products provided in a GeoTiff format on a spatially uniform 1 m resolution grid on 1 by 1km tiles.
