NEON AOP instruments, including the full waveform LiDAR, are flown at 1000 m above ground level at 100 knots in flight lines that have 37% overlap. Data are acquired at a minimum density of 4 LiDAR shots per square meter in non-overlap areas. NEON AOP LiDAR returns are full waveforms, from which up to 5 points per shot may be discretized. NEON sites are flown once per year with a target of 90% of maximum greenness or higher and at a minimum of 3 of every 4 years. Flight coverage is a minimum of 10 km by 10 km and covers both NEON tower and observational sampling sites. Aquatic sites, as well as the terrestrial sites in Hawaii and Puerto Rico, are flown in the same fashion, but at reduced frequency.
