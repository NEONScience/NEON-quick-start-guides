Raw discrete LiDAR data are processed to projected and corrected L1 LAZ point clouds in their original flight lines. Last (lowest elevation) returns are gridded to 1 m pixels to create a bare earth digital elevation model (DEM). Triangulation and interpolation are used to fill any gaps in DEM data if the LiDAR was unable to reach the ground. Slope and aspect are then calculated through multiple algorithms, creating two separate filtered DTM tiles in Geotiff format. See ATBD for algorithm details.
