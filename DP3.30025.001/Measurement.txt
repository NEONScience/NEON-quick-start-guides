Slope measures the gradient of how steep a surface is determined by the ratio of rise over run of the surveyed surface. Aspect measures the direction of the previous identified slope, measured in degrees referenced to grid north. Both are presented in GeoTiff raster format, divided into 1 km by 1 km tiles.
