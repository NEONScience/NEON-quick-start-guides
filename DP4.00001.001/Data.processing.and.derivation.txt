To minimize required calculation, values are generated in a 'cascading' fashion.  Daily values are calculated from aggregated data falling between 00:00:00 and 23:59:59 hours on a given day.  Those values are then used to produce monthly values only once all daily values of a given month are generated. Once all monthly summaries are complete for a calendar year, then a yearly summary of statistics is generated. For all data products except Precipitation (DP1.00006.001) the daily, monthly, and yearly mean of a given value is calculated.
