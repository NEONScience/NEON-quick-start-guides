L4 data products rely on QA/QC procedures of the underlying L1 data products to report data quality. Final quality flags will be generated for each group of data products based on the percent of the underlying data with a final quality flag raised. Raising a quality flag at a given temporal level requires 20% or more data at the underlying temporal level be missing or have a quality flag or final quality flag of 1.
