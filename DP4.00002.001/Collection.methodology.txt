Sensible heat flux is estimated based on the eddy covariance technique using a 3D sonic anemometer to determine vertical winds and air temperature (corrected with water vapor measured by a fast-response infrared gas analyzer (IRGA) at 20 Hz to calculate the turbulent flux, and using platinum resistance temperature detectors (PRTs) to measure tower profile air temperature at 1 Hz to calculate storage flux. Net surface-atmosphere exchange (NSAE) is calculated as the sum of turbulent flux and storage flux above.
