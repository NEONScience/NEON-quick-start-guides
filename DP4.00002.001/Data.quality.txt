Each measurement is accompanied by a final quality flag (qfFinl) in the "qfqm" sub-directory for each data level of the HDF5 bundled file. NEON recommends only using data where the corresponding final quality flag is 0. Data with a final quality flag of 1 are potentially inaccurate and should only be used with caution. The final quality flag is based on automated QA/QC tests, including range, step, and spike tests, as well as a manually set science review flag if applicable. Uncertainty metrics are available at the dp01 level for each level 1 data product in the "dp01/ucrt" sub-directory.
