Carbon dioxide flux is estimated by using sonic anemometer measurements of vertical winds velocity and an infrared gas analyzer (IRGA) measurements of CO2 concentration. Vertical wind measurements are taken at the tower top and CO2 concentration measurements are taken at every measurement level of the tower. Measurements are representative of a spatial point in time and are made at 1 Hz (CO2 concentration) and 20 Hz (wind velocity). Data are published in 30-min temporally averaged data products.
