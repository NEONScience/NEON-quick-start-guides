CO2 flux is estimated based on eddy covariance technique using a 3D sonic anemometer to measure vertical winds and a fast-response infrared gas analyzer (IRGA) to measure CO2 concentration at 20 Hz to calculate turbulent flux, and using a slow-response IRGA to measure tower profile CO2 concentration at 1 Hz to calculate storage flux. Net ecosystem exchange (NSAE) of CO2 were calculated based on above turbulent flux and storage flux.
