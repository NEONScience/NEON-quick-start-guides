Refer to the documentation for Elevation of surface water (DP1.20016.001), Discharge field collection (DP1.20048.001), Gauge height (DP1.20267.001), and Stage-discharge rating curves (DP4.00133.001) for information about data quality in the input data products. Continuous discharge data include both data flags and uncertainty estimates for the calculated stage and discharge. Beginning with RELEASE-2025 and in all subsequent releases, applying to all Water Years starting with Water Year 2022 (from October 1, 2021), when continuous discharge data cannot be cleaned and gap filled using the methods documented in the Data Processing section, values are set to NA. For data collected prior to Water Year 2022, and all water years in Releases prior to RELEASE-2025, maxpost discharge data identified as potentially suspect have the dischargeFinalQF set to 1. Estimated upper and lower bounds of parametric and remnant uncertainty from the Bayesian model are provided.

Please note that quality checks are comprehensive but not exhaustive; therefore, unknown data quality issues may exist. Also note that, conversely, some quality-flagged data are still usable depending on the scientific use case. Users are advised to evaluate quality of the data as relevant to the scientific research question being addressed, perform data review and post-processing prior to analysis, and use the data quality flags, issue logs, and maintenance records included in download packages to aid interpretation.
