Quality control measures on Level 0 and Level 1 data products ensure the quality of Level 4 data products. In addition to the estimates of continuous discharge (maxPostDischarge field in csd_continuousDischarge table), NEON data downloads include upper and lower uncertainty bounds based on the Monte Carlo sampling that the BaRatin software uses and two uncertainty estimates. Parametric uncertainty is determined using the uncertainty estimates produced by the NEON calibration and validation laboratory for a given sensor. The remnant uncertainty is determined using the goodness of fit between model outputs and empirical discharge measurements for the time range covering an entire rating curve.

Please note that quality checks are comprehensive but not exhaustive; therefore, unknown data quality issues may exist. Users are advised to evaluate quality of the data as relevant to the scientific research question being addressed, perform data review and post-processing prior to analysis, and use the data quality information and issue logs included in download packages to aid interpretation.
