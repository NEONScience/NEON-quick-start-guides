Continuous discharge is a Level 4 data product, meaning it undergoes additional levels of processing and quality control.  Beginning with RELEASE-2025, continuous discharge data collected from Water Year 2022 (starting October 1, 2021) and later, which cannot be cleaned and gap filled using the methods documented in the Data Processing section are set to NA.  For data collected prior to Water Year 2022 (and including Water Year 2022 in RELEASE-2024), cleaned and gap filled continuous discharge is not provided, and maxpostDischarge data identified as potentially suspect has the dischargeFinalQF set to 1.  It is the responsibility of the user to review the additional information including the individual quality flags and the Issue Log to determine which data they are comfortable using.
