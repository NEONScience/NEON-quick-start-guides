Quality control measures on Level 0 and Level 1 data products ensure the quality of Level 4 data products. In addition to the estimates of continuous discharge (maxPostDischarge field in csd_continuousDischarge_pub table), NEON data downloads include upper and lower uncertainty bounds based on the Monte Carlo sampling that the BaRatin software uses and two uncertainty estimates. Parametric uncertainty is determined using the uncertainty estimates produced by the NEON calibration and validation laboratory for a given sensor. The remnant uncertainty is determined using the goodness of fit between model outputs and empirical discharge measurements for the time range covering an entire rating curve.
