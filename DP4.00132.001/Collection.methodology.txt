In order to collect this data product, a suite of hydroacoustic instrumentation is secured to a vessel and equipped with a differential global positioning system (DGPS). Acoustic images are obtained via side scan sonar and formatted post-sampling to produce a master mosaic image with ground truth observations. The vessel begins along the shoreline and forms a grid pattern in lakes and repeats parallel lines for rivers (Fig 1). Bathymetric surveys are done on 5 year intervals at lake sites during the summer biological bout to capture peak greenness, and annually at river sites.
