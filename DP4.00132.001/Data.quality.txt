NEON data quality measures begin at the point of data entry. By constraining formats and controlling values with dropdown menus NEON reduced the number of steps to process raw data. Data are processed using automated methods. These are outlined in the NEON Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document: OS Generic Transitions. A more specific description of constrained can be found in the field ‘entryValidationRulesParser’ of the document NEON Raw Data Validation for Bathymetric and Morphological Maps (NEON.DP0.00132) which is provided as an additional download with this data product. Field survey notes are review during the quality check process to flag errors that were reported during the survey. As with all spatial datasets there is a level on unavoidable uncertainty. Dense canopy at some sites forces GPS coordinates to fall outside the desired range.
