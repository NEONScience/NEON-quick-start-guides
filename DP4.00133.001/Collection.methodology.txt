Level 4 data is the product of Level 0 and higher data product inputs with occasional calculations. For details on stream discharge collection see Discharge Protocol/User Guide. NEON rating curves are developed using Bayesian modeling methods based on the Bayesian Rating Curve Advanced Graphical Environment (BaRatinAGE). Rating curves are updated at the end of each water year (October 1 - September 30).
