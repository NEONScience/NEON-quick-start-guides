A Docker container with R coding is used to recreate the rating curve every 366 days to produce the annual rating curve. Hydraulic controls are used to develop the “prior” rating curve. These hydraulic controls physical dimensions and the number of controls selected in addition to the physical dimensions of the channel are derived from cross-section survey data. Using these products, an exponential equation is created for each and calculated. With Bayesian estimation and Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling, a “posterior” rating curve can be fit using the “prior” rating curve created earlier and gauge height
