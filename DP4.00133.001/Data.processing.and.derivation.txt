Rating curves are developed using Bayesian BaRatin software (Le Coz et al., 2014; Horner et al., 2018). Hydraulic controls based on the Stream morphology map (DP4.00131.001), for stream sites, or Bathymetric and mophological maps (DP4.00132.001), for river and lake sites, are used to develop the “prior” rating curve. Inputs that define the controls include channel slope, channel geometry, and channel roughness (see https://github.com/NEONScience/NEON-stream-discharge/tree/master/hydrologicControls for code used to develop the controls used as Bayesian priors). Detailed information on the prior controls are published in the geo/bat_controlInfo, geo/bat_controlType, and geo/bat_priorParameters tables. A set of paired stage and discharge empirical measurements (from past and current water years) are used with the prior controls to create a posterior model in the BaRatin software (see https://github.com/NEONScience/NEON-stream-discharge/tree/master/L4Discharge for code and more information on the software used to produce the rating curves). Rating curves are updated each water year (Oct 1 - Sept 30) and more than one rating curve may be produced for a given water year if conditions at the site change the relationship between stage and discharge mid-water year (e.g. an extremely high-flow event alters channel morphology) .
