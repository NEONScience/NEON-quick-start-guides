Each rating curve applies to a specific site and time range (identified by the curveID and cureveSegmentID fields in the sdrc_stageDischargeCurveInfo_pub table) that reflect a stable relationship between stage and discharge. If infrastructure (e.g. a staff gauge is moved) or ecological conditions (e.g. a high-flow even changes channel morphology) lead to a change in that relationship, an existing rating curve would end and a new one would be created to represent the new relationship. Individual paired stage and discharge measurements used to compute hte posterior rating curve model are published in the sdrc_gaugeDischargeMeas_pub table. Instances where the recalculated discharge value in htis table differs from the L1 published discharge value, the recalculatedL1QF is set to 1. This difference occurs primarily due to data edits made following the wading survey to point measurements. The sdrc_posteriorParameters table contains record for each posterior control that define the modeled relationship between stage and discharge. All 500 Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampled parameters are published in the sdrc_sampledParameters table and model residuals are in the sdrc_resultsResiduals table for users interested in analysis of detailed outputs of the Bayesian model or re-creating the NEON rating curve.
