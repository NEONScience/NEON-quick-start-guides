Latent heat flux is estimated based on eddy covariance technique using a 3D sonic anemometer to measure vertical winds and a fast-response infrared gas analyzer (IRGA) to measure water vapor at 20 Hz to calculate turbulent flux, and using a slow-response IRGA to measure tower profile water vapor at 1 Hz to calculate storage flux. Net surface-atmosphere exchange (NSAE) of water vapor is calculated as the sum of turbulent flux and storage flux above.
