The critical site metadata can be found in the HDF5 file location FILE/SITE “Metadata” tab, when clicking on FILE/SITE code on the top of the HDF5 file, which include ecosystem type (TypeEco), tower location (LatTow, LonTow; °) and elevation (ElevRefeTow; m), tower height (DistZaxsTow; m), canopy height (DistZaxsCnpy; m), number of measurement levels (LvlMeasTow), the height of each measurement levels (DistZaxsLvlMeasTow; m), the transit time for air sample travels from inlet at each measurement levels to analyzer (TimeTube; s), etc.

For more information about using HDF5 files, see our how to view an HDF5 file document.

We suggest the following data use workflow:
1) Download the desired site-months from the data portal with documentation included.
2) Review the Eddy-Covariance Data Product Bundle ATBD (NEON.DOC.004571). This document contains definitions of terms used in the HDF5 file, as well as specific HDF5 file paths for each data product. 
3) To interact with the HDF5 files, we recommend downloading the free HDFView software to become familiar with file contents. For further analysis, we suggest using the neonUtilities::stackEddy() function or the rhdf5 package in R, and the h5py package in Python.
4) Search the Data Portal News and data product issue log for information regarding known data quality concerns.
