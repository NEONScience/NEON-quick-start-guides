Samples are collected from both tower and observational plots across the NEON site. A spectroradiometer is used to take either field or lab measurements of the raw spectral reflectance of samples. Spectral reflectance of both the front and back of the sample is measured against a nearly 100% reflective white spectralon reference panel. A black spectralon reference is then measured, followed by spectral transmittance measurements of the front and back of the sample. Reference measurements of the white reference are taken between each leaf measurement.",n/a,n/a,A handheld imaging spectroradiometer form Analytical Spectral Devices (ASD) is used to collect measurements either in the field or on pre-collected samples in the laboratory. The instrument is calibrated at the beginning of the season using readings taken from an ASD calibration spectralon panel.,,Raw spectroradiometer measurements are a combination of both the sample and the light source. A white reference panel is measured between each set of sample measurements in order to determine the contribution of the light source. A black panel is also measured and used as the backdrop for sample transmittance measurements. A set of equations is used to create calibrated spectral reflectance values from the raw digital number obtained from the ASD instrument.,"Quality control constraints are implemented during data entry and ingestion, for example by restricting the allowable formats or values for each field. A mobile application or web user interface is used for data entry, which standardizes records and flags or disallows non-conforming entries.

For example, data collected prior to 2019 were recorded on paper datasheets and are accompanied by the “legacyData” quality flag.",,n/a,,,,,

Orthorectification is the process of remapping the pixels in an image from the captured projection to a regular geographic projection while removing distortions introduced by land surface topography, imperfections in the camera lens, and tilt of the camera caused by aircraft attitude variations.  The orthorectification process consists of defining a uniform grid on the ground covering the full extent of the image through a series of data-frame transformations. Then each ground pixel is ray-traced back up to the camera image, filling in each orthorectified pixel with the nearest-neighbor image pixel.

NEON has developed an algorithm to perform the following steps. First, orthorectified images are selected for mosaicking based on location and orientation, typically from only North-South survey lines. Next, the zenith angle, or the angle between the orthogonal direction of the pixel plane and nadir, is found for each pixel and stored in a zenith file. The aggregate of these files determines the coverage area of the mosaic and 1km x 1km tiles are created within this area. Then, all of the overlapping images within a tile are found. Within these images, the pixels that are facing the most upwards, or have the smallest zenith angle, are selected to populate the tile. This process reduces distortion effects caused by the difference in resolution between the digital terrain model and the images, which can cause unnatural features to display such as swirls and outward bending. Placing the tiles next to each other creates the mosaic for the entire area surveyed. Because of the nature of the surveys, images for an entire site may be collected over many days with different lighting conditions. This can cause contrast differences that can sometimes be seen in the mosaic, with darker appearing areas next to lighter appearing areas of the same objects.","Orthorectified images have location uncertainties of below 0.5m, or 5 pixels, previously calculated with the L1 product.
